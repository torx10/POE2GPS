# Changelog

All notable changes to POE2GPS. This project is a strictly read-only, GGG-compliant PoE2 navigation overlay.
Versions are GitHub release tags (`vX.Y.Z`); the in-app update checker compares against the latest.

## Unreleased — September 2026 compatibility

- Updated the GameState signature to wildcard the build-dependent JNZ displacement and validate the longer instruction sequence.
- Ported the PoE2 0.5.5 InGameState, AreaInstance, AreaInfo, Entity, ServerData, MapUiElement, and non-uniform UiElement layout changes.
- Updated Atlas node reads for the current layout: GridPos remains `+0x310`, while State, MapRowIndex, Biome, and Flags are read from their current byte fields; Completion is exposed as an observational candidate only.
- Replaced legacy scalar/child content inference with a bounded `std::vector<byte>` reader at `+0x368/+0x370/+0x378`. API and Research diagnostics expose raw ContentIds and names from the checked-in numeric snapshot; the live EndgameMapContent/VisualIdentity pointer chain remains unresolved.
- Confirmed `AtlasNode.DataBiome = 0x2BE`; runtime validated `4997/4997` exact matches across `11` distinct biome values. The Research validator now treats it as a known deep-model mirror and reports direct-vs-deep mismatches; the rejected `+0x2BB` candidate is retained only for comparison output.
- Fixed local builds reporting stale version metadata; source builds now report `0.42.4` and cannot self-replace through the automatic updater.

## [0.42.4] — 2026-07-26 "Let The Cap Breathe"

*Audit of the audit. v0.42.3 fixed a real cooldown defect — a restored FPS cap had to wait out another full 10-second window before it could re-throttle — but it fixed it all the way to zero. Because the engage gate measures from the last **engage**, it's already satisfied the instant a restore happens, so a scene with sparse activity re-throttled about half a second after every restore and the cap sat at its floor roughly 95% of the time. That's the "overlay stopped working" symptom v0.42.2 flipped the default for, arriving by a different road. This drop adds a dwell floor: the cap has to stay released a while before staleness can pull it back down. Only reaches you if you opted back into the auto-throttle — it's still off by default.*

### Fixed

- 🩺 **Auto-throttle pinned the FPS cap in semi-quiet scenes** — v0.42.3's engage-to-engage cooldown left no minimum un-throttled dwell, so `restore → ~500 ms → re-throttle` cycled indefinitely and the adapted cap was effectively permanent. New `ReEngageCoolDownSeconds` (default `5`) requires the cap to stay restored that long before a fresh stale run may re-engage. Engage now needs **both** the engage-to-engage window and the dwell floor, which keeps v0.42.3's actual fix intact. Set it to `0` for exact v0.42.3 behavior. Configurable via `radar-settings.json`.
- ⚙️ **Settings migrations claimed success they hadn't earned** — `Save()` swallowed IO failures and returned void, so a migration whose flag never reached disk logged "migrated stale mechanic rules (Expedition/Strongbox category gating)" — the wrong migration name — and then silently re-ran on every launch, re-forcing `AutoAdaptTickCadence = false` over a deliberate opt-in each time. `Save()` now reports failure and the load path says plainly when migrations couldn't be persisted. (Visibility, not immunity: an unwritable config file still can't retain the flags.)

### Changed — 🩺 Diagnostics

- 🩺 **`/api/probe/gamefps` int samples now name their gate.** `GameFpsIntSample` gained `Gate` — `"monotonic"`, `"smoothed"`, or `null`. v0.42.3's smoothed gate can't distinguish a real FPS integer from any other stable small int in `[15..300]` on a two-shot sample, so it necessarily flags a lot of unrelated fields across the 241-offset sweep. Both modes collapsed into one bool made a support payload hard to read; naming the mode makes it sortable high-confidence-first.

### Tests

- +2 net xUnit facts. Full suite: **1539 pass / 3 skipped / 0 failed** (baseline 1537).
- Replaced v0.42.3's cooldown regression guard, which set `StaleAdaptCoolDownSeconds = 0` — at zero, the *pre-fix* expression `now - _lastActionTicks >= 0` is also always true, so the test passed against the very code it claimed to guard. Rewritten with a non-zero cooldown, plus two new facts covering the dwell floor and its `0` opt-out.
- De-flaked `SweepInGameStateInt_MonotonicCandidate_PassesSignature`, which failed intermittently under full-suite parallel load (5 ms mutator against a 30 ms sample window). Rebuilt on the async overload: the first window read completes synchronously before the first `await`, so the mutation lands provably between the two reads with no timing margin to lose. The two sync-path mutator tests got wide margins instead.

### Upgrade

Fully automatic via the in-app update checker. No action needed — `AutoAdaptTickCadence` remains **off by default** and this release does not change that. If you opted back in, you'll get the dwell floor automatically; tune `ReEngageCoolDownSeconds` in `radar-settings.json` if 5 seconds doesn't suit your setup.

## [0.42.3] — 2026-07-21 "Post-Audit Sweep"

*Ran a focused audit over the v0.42.x additions — read-throw defects, concurrency, loopback gates, wire-format compat, config-default drift, C1/C2 edge cases. Everything either clean or fixed here. Highlight: v0.42.2's default flip was inert for the users it was meant to protect (the persisted setting overrode the new default on load). This drop's one-time migration flips it once for everyone, then respects any explicit opt-in going forward.*

### Fixed

- 🎮 **v0.42.2 hotfix was inert for existing users** — HIGH severity. The `RadarSettings` JSON serializer uses `DefaultIgnoreCondition.Never`, so v0.42.1's default `"autoAdaptTickCadence": true` was persisted to every existing user's `radar_settings.json`. When v0.42.2 loaded that file, the persisted `true` overrode the new `false` default → the hotfix did nothing for anyone hit by the C1 regression. New one-time migration flag `AutoAdaptTickCadenceMigratedV0423`: on load, if not yet set, force `AutoAdaptTickCadence = false` and mark the migration done. Users who explicitly re-enable it after v0.42.3 keep their choice.
- 🩺 **`TickCadenceMonitor` init-fingerprint misprime** — the first `RecordWorldTick(0)` call after startup collided with `_lastFingerprint`'s default zero and started `_staleTicks` off-by-one. Post-fix, the first call always records as a change regardless of numeric value via a `_hasFirstFingerprint` guard.
- 🩺 **`TickCadenceMonitor` restore-then-re-throttle blocked by shared cooldown** — the single `_lastActionTicks` field was updated on both engage AND restore, so a fresh over-polling event within the cooldown window after a restore could not re-throttle. Split into `_lastThrottleTicks` (gates engage) and `_lastRestoreTicks` (informational only). The anti-oscillation window now applies engage-to-engage where it belongs.

### Added — 🩺 Signature-gate extension

- 🩺 **`/api/probe/gamefps` int sweep** now passes signature for smoothed FPS integers too, not just monotonic frame counters. New gate: `(second > first && delta in [15..300])` OR `(first in [15..300] && second in [15..300] && |delta| <= 3)`. Catches game engines that expose FPS as a rounded/smoothed int alongside a raw frame counter.
- 🩺 **Async sweep overloads** — `GameFpsProber.SweepXxxAsync` variants use `Task.Delay` instead of `Thread.Sleep`. The `/api/probe/gamefps` endpoint's four concurrent 1-second sweeps no longer pin four ThreadPool threads for the full sample window.

### Tests

- +8 xUnit facts (3 for the migration, 2 for the `TickCadenceMonitor` fixes, 3 for the smoothed-FPS gate + async overloads). Full suite: **1537 pass / 3 skipped / 0 failed** (baseline 1529; delta = +8).

### Under the hood

- Full sweep of all 6 v0.42 probers plus the inline sweeps in `Poe2Live.ProbeEntities` confirmed no unwrapped throwing memory reads (`ReadPointer` / `ReadStringUtf16`) that could propagate exceptions out to callers.
- All 8 `/api/probe/*` endpoints verified loopback-Host-gated with method-gate + provider-null guard.
- `HealedOffsetCache` concurrency race (from v0.42.1-wip) confirmed still fixed; instance-scoped diagnostic state (`_lastGroundItems` ring buffer, UiFlags snapshot ring) verified thread-safe under x64 memory model.
- `RadarState.Cadence` nullable init property has exactly one consumer (`ApiServer` `/api/state`) which uses `is { } tc` null-check pattern. No frontend consumer.

### Upgrade

Fully automatic via the in-app update checker. On first load under v0.42.3, the migration forces `AutoAdaptTickCadence = false` if it isn't already, then sets a flag so subsequent loads don't touch the field. If you explicitly want the C1 auto-throttle behavior, set `"AutoAdaptTickCadence": true` in `radar-settings.json` AFTER v0.42.3 has run once — the migration won't overwrite explicit post-migration opt-ins.

## [0.42.2] — 2026-07-20 "Quiet Scenes Aren't Stale Bytes"

*Shipped an auto-throttle heuristic yesterday. It false-positives on any 500 ms quiet moment — right after a zone loads while entities are still populating, or just standing still with no monsters nearby — and locks the FPS cap at 30 for 10+ seconds. On a 240 Hz monitor that reads as "overlay stopped working." Flipping the default off until we can rebuild the trigger on a real game-FPS signal (the C2 diagnostic is exactly for finding that offset). All the v0.42.1 code stays in place — opt in with one config line if it worked for you.*

### Fixed

- 🎮 **`AutoAdaptTickCadence` default flipped from `true` → `false`.** The fingerprint (`entityCount + areaInstance + localPlayer + areaHash`) conflates "significant game-state change" with "reads are working" — a quiet scene where nothing enters or leaves the entity list produces 15 byte-identical ticks, the throttle engages, and the 10-second cooldown (which requires a fingerprint change to re-arm) holds the cap at 30 FPS until something in the world moves. The signature we actually want ("game IS updating but we're reading stale bytes") needs the game-FPS offset that C2 is meant to help locate. Until we have it, the heuristic is unsafe as a default.

### Under the hood

- All v0.42.1 C1 code stays in place — `TickCadenceMonitor`, the `tickCadence` block in `/api/state`, `StaleFingerprintTickThreshold`, `StaleAdaptCoolDownSeconds`. The only change is one line in `RadarSettings` (`AutoAdaptTickCadence = false`). If v0.42.1 fixed your controller-mode HP-bar freeze and you want to keep it, set `"AutoAdaptTickCadence": true` in `radar-settings.json` and everything works as it did yesterday.
- 🩺 **C2 diagnostic (`/api/probe/gamefps`) stays live.** This is the endpoint that maps the real game-FPS offset — the payload we need to replace the C1 fingerprint heuristic with a direct read. Loopback-Host-gated (raw pointers never leave your machine). If you're on a high-refresh setup with an in-game FPS cap active, `curl http://localhost:16311/api/probe/gamefps` returns in ~1 second and the JSON tells us which offset holds the number.

### Tests

- No test changes. Suite stays at **1529 pass / 3 skipped / 0 failed**. The regression is a default-value flip, not a logic bug — the existing `TickCadenceMonitor` tests still cover the behavior for opt-in users.

### Upgrade

Fully automatic via the in-app update checker. Anyone already on v0.42.1 who hit the regression can either update to v0.42.2 or work around it immediately by editing `radar-settings.json` and setting `"AutoAdaptTickCadence": false` — the flipped default is the entire fix.

### Sorry

- Shipped a heuristic on a signal that wasn't specific enough. The right trigger needs a real game-FPS read, and building that on top of C2's payload is the v0.42.3+ scope. Thanks to everyone who reported the 30-FPS lock — that's the signal that got us here.

## [0.42.1] — 2026-07-20 "Controller-Mode Freeze Fix + Cadence Probe"

*Field-diagnosed by streamer @themostepic (playing via Moonlight): when the overlay's render rate is much higher than the game's actual render rate, per-frame memory reads outrun the game's state updates and controller-mode users see HP bars freeze / plugins appear stuck for a couple of seconds. Manual workaround (match the two rates) is now automatic. Ships alongside a diagnostic probe so the "real" game FPS offset can be mapped from a support payload.*

### Fixed

- 🎮 **Controller-mode "HP bars freeze / plugins freeze for a couple of seconds"** — automatic. A new `TickCadenceMonitor` hashes a small state fingerprint (`entityCount + areaInstance + localPlayer + areaHash`) at the end of every world tick; when the fingerprint is byte-identical for 15 consecutive ticks (~500 ms at WorldHz=30) — the "reads returning stale bytes" signature — the render loop drops its effective FPS cap to match the observed change rate (floored at 30) via `Math.Min(configuredCap, adaptedCap)`. A 10-second cooldown of resumed changes restores the cap. Zero new game memory offsets read.

### Added — 🩺 **Diagnostic surface for the real fix**

- 🩺 **`/api/probe/gamefps`** — two-shot sampling (read → sleep 1s → read) at candidate offsets on InGameState (0x40..0x400 step 4) and Camera (0x00..0x200 step 4), both int and float. Signature-passes: a monotonic int with delta ∈ [15, 300] (frame counter or smoothed FPS int) or a float in (0, 1) with < 25% inter-sample jitter (frame time in seconds). Loopback-Host-gated. When a real-world payload identifies the offset, a follow-up bead can replace the C1 fingerprint heuristic with a direct game-FPS read.
- 🩺 **`tickCadence` block in `/api/state`** — `{worldHz, effectiveWorldHz, staleTicks, adaptedFpsCap, configuredFpsCap, monitorHz}` for support diagnosis when auto-throttle misfires on unusual hardware.

### Config

Three new `RadarSettings` knobs (all default-safe; the fix is on by default):

- `AutoAdaptTickCadence` (bool, default `true`) — the main toggle. Set `false` to restore the classic fixed `FpsCap` behavior.
- `StaleFingerprintTickThreshold` (int, default `15`) — sensitivity knob. Higher = more tolerant of legit static scenes (deep hideout idle, menu screens); lower = quicker throttle response.
- `StaleAdaptCoolDownSeconds` (int, default `10`) — anti-oscillation. Minimum seconds between throttle adjustments.

### Under the hood

- Cleanup that landed alongside: `HealedOffsetCache.Persist()` snapshot+write race closed under a dedicated `_persistLock` (was losing one entry in 100 under concurrent `SetHealed` writes); `AreaInstanceProber.SweepLocalPlayer` + `SweepServerDataPtr` swapped from `ReadPointer` (throws on invalid handles) to `TryReadStruct<nint>` (matches `SweepAwakeEntities` "read-fail" convention), unblocking 4 previously-skipped tests; `EntityProbeSample_ConstructedRecord_RoundTripsAllFields` synced to B7a's 12-field record shape.
- Full sweep of all 6 v0.42 probers confirmed no other unwrapped throwing reads remain.
- Parallelized the C2 endpoint: the 4 sweeps run in parallel via `Task.Run` — endpoint returns in ~1 second instead of 4. `TryReadStruct` is thread-safe on the same handle.

### Tests

- 18 new xUnit facts (12 for `TickCadenceMonitor` including a concurrent-read tearing regression guard; 6 for `GameFpsProber`). Full suite: **1529 pass / 3 skipped / 0 failed** (baseline 1511; delta = +18).

### Upgrade

Fully additive. No config migration; the fix engages automatically on first attach. If you want the classic behavior back, set `AutoAdaptTickCadence: false` in `radar-settings.json`. If auto-throttle misfires on your setup, hit `curl http://localhost:16311/api/state` — the `tickCadence` block shows what's happening (compare `effectiveWorldHz` to `worldHz=30`; when the two diverge, the throttle engaged).

### Shout-outs

- **@themostepic** — clean field diagnosis of the two-rates-must-match relationship. Turned a "not sure what's happening" report into a one-line reproduction plan.

## [0.42.0] — 2026-07-19 "Patch-Day Diagnostics"

*Eight `/api/probe/*` endpoints now surface exactly which internal game-memory offsets each subsystem uses. When the next patch shifts something, a payload paste points to the drift within seconds — no more speculative-hotfix scramble.*

### Added — 🩺 **Eight new diagnostic endpoints for offset-drift triage**

- 🩺 **`/api/probe/area`** — sweeps the 5 AreaInstance high-field offsets (AwakeEntities, SleepingEntities, LocalPlayer, ServerDataPtr, TerrainMetadata). This one family has drifted twice in three weeks (2026-06-25 +0x18, 2026-07-16 +0x08); the endpoint now surfaces the drift on the next request.
- 🩺 **`/api/probe/atlas-graph`** — sweeps AtlasNode.ConnectionsVec + GridPos + Biome for the atlas routing graph (the app's namesake feature). If routes go blank after a patch, the payload shows which of the three offsets moved.
- 🩺 **`/api/probe/buffs`** — sweeps BuffsComponent.BuffVector + StatusEffect.Definition on live elite entities. Silent-empty buff nameplates were previously invisible; the endpoint now shows exactly why.
- 🩺 **`/api/probe/item`** — sweeps WorldItemComponent.ItemEntity + ModsComponent.Rarity + RenderItemComponent.ResourcePath + BaseComponent.NameRow on the last 8 ground drops. `Rarity` misreads (silent-suppress drops from the Drop Timeline) now surface immediately.
- 🩺 **`/api/probe/monolith`** — sweeps RuneStation.ListenerSub + RuneStride per device. Both offsets drifted on 2026-06-25 and are the same volatility class as Life.EnergyShield; the endpoint eliminates the guesswork.
- 🩺 **`/api/probe/uielement`** — two-mode flag-snapshot diagnostic. `?snapshot=1` records the 32-bit words at UiElement.Flags candidate offsets on the atlas panel; a second call (with the atlas toggled between hits) shows which offset's bit flipped — that's the true `Flags` location.
- 🩺 **`/api/entity-probe` extended** with four new sweep arrays per sample (EntityDetailsPtr / ComponentList / EntityDetails.Name / ComponentLookUp.NameAndIndexBucket) — the 5-hop Entity chain root has zero prior coverage; the extension makes every hop diagnosable in one hit.
- 🩺 **OMP monster-rarity sweep** appended to `/api/entity-probe` — sweeps ObjectMagicProperties.Rarity candidate offsets on each sampled entity. Every monster reading Normal (the silent-critical failure mode) becomes visible.

All endpoints are **loopback-Host-gated** (raw pointers in the response body — never leave your machine).

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Diagnostics` namespace with `ProbeSample<T>` positional record (`OffsetHex` / `TargetAddr` / `Value` / `ReadFailReason` / `PassesSignature`) + `HealedOffsetCache` static (thread-safe cache with `config/healed-offsets.json` atomic-write persistence, invalidation on 30-day stale, loud `[OFFSET-HEAL]` console + rolling log on relocation) + `HealedOffsetsFile` load/save + `SerializeProbeResponse` helper in `ApiServer`. Ships as **B0 shared scaffold**; the 8 per-family beads (B1a/B2a/B3a/B4a/B5a/B6a/B7a/B8a) each consume it.
- 8 new prober classes under `POE2Radar.Core.Diagnostics` — `AreaInstanceProber`, `AtlasGraphProber`, `BuffProber`, `ItemProber`, `MonolithProber`, `UiElementFlagsProber`, plus entity-chain sweeps inline in `Poe2Live.ProbeEntities`.
- New `Poe2Atlas.FirstNodeAddr` public accessor — thread-safe pointer to the first cached atlas-node UiElement, or 0 when the canvas is undetected. Feeds `/api/probe/atlas-graph`.
- `EntityProbeSample` record grew 7 → 12 positional fields (existing 7 preserved in order; 5 new appended in v0.42 so JSON consumers on older clients don't miss existing fields).
- `HealedOffsetCache` is wired into B0 but no consumer routes reads through it yet — the auto-heal beads (B1b through B8b) ship in v0.42.1+.

### Tests

- ~90 new xUnit facts across 8 new prober test files. Full suite grows to 1506 (all green, plus 4 pre-existing skips: 1 SSE-integration, 3 B1a `SweepLocalPlayer`/`SweepServerDataPtr` throw-on-invalid-handle follow-up).

### Not shipped yet (v0.42.1+ backlog)

- **Auto-heal** — the 8 per-family "Bxb" beads that route consumer reads through `HealedOffsetCache.Resolve` and signature-scan for alternate offsets on sustained read failures. Once v0.42 confirms the diagnostic pattern works in the field, auto-heal cascades on top.
- **HealthState verdicts** — dashboard Diagnostics-tab red badges for silent-critical states (30s in a map with 30 monsters but 0 rarities > Normal → "OMP Rarity may have drifted"). Same v0.42.1+ scope.
- **`Rarity Canary` session metric** — % of monsters cached as Normal in non-town zones. B7b scope.

### Upgrade

Fully additive. No config migration. All 8 endpoints are loopback-only diagnostic surface; the game-facing behavior is byte-identical to v0.41.9. If a patch breaks something, `curl /api/probe/<family>` gives a payload that pinpoints the drift in seconds instead of the multi-hotfix scramble.

## [0.41.9] — 2026-07-19 "Controller-Mode Atlas Fix (Tier-Preference)"

*v0.41.8's "prefer visible=true" wasn't specific enough — controller-mode UI has multiple visible panels matching the loose child-count signature. This drop uses a proper tier preference.*

### Fixed

- 🎮 **Controller-mode `atlas closed` false-positive — actually fixed this time.** Field payload confirmed: when the atlas is open in controller mode, UiRoot has multiple `[8, 30]`-child-signature-matching visible panels (index 17 with 9 children, index 19 with 9 children, index 97 with 18 children). v0.41.8's "first visible signature match by distance-from-primary" logic picked index 19 (visible, 9 children, close to primary=22) before reaching index 97 — landed on the wrong panel, cached it, kept reporting "atlas closed."

### Changed

- 🎯 **Selection now uses a 4-tier preference:**
  1. `childCount == 18` AND `visible = true` → strongest match (the true atlas panel — both keyboard index 22 AND controller index 97 have exactly 18 children)
  2. `childCount == 18` regardless of visibility → historical signature match
  3. `childCount in [8, 30]` AND `visible = true` → loose fallback with visibility
  4. `childCount in [8, 30]` → last resort
  Within each tier, closer-to-primary=22 wins the ordering. Exact-18 beats any loose match, so the algorithm now walks past visible 9-child panels to reach the 18-child atlas panel.

### Under the hood

- New private helper `Poe2Atlas.ReadElementChildCount(firstChildPtr, index)` reads just the child count of a candidate panel without touching the visibility/signature state, keeping the tier logic clean.
- Cached fast-path unchanged — this only affects the slow-path scan that runs on cache miss or after a UI-mode swap.

### Upgrade

**Recommended for controller-mode users.** If v0.41.8 still showed "atlas closed," this build lands the correct panel (index 97 or wherever your controller-mode atlas actually is) via strict-18 preference.

## [0.41.8] — 2026-07-19 "Controller-Mode Atlas Fix"

*Actually FIXES the controller-mode "atlas closed" false-positive after v0.41.7's diagnostic pinpointed the true panel index.*

### Fixed

- 🎮 **Controller-mode users no longer see "atlas closed" when their atlas is open.** v0.41.7's diagnostic proved the theory: UiRoot has multiple `[8, 30]`-child-signature-matching panels. In controller mode, the historical index 22 panel (18 children) stays `visible=false` — it's a keyboard-mode-only artifact — while the true controller-mode atlas panel sits at a different index (index 97 in the reference field payload, also with 18 children) and correctly toggles `visible=true`.
- 🎯 **Selection logic now prefers `visible=true` among signature matches.** The scan enumerates every `[8, 30]`-child candidate in UiRoot's children, picks the first one whose visible bit is on, and caches its index. Falls back to the first-any-signature-match only when nothing is currently visible (atlas genuinely closed). Keyboard-mode users still land on index 22 as before — its visible bit toggles correctly when the atlas is open on keyboard mode.

### Under the hood

- Rewrote the slow-path scan in `Poe2Atlas.AtlasPanelOpen` to enumerate all signature-matching candidates and pick by `visible=true` preference instead of first-signature-match-wins-by-distance.
- Cache remains keyed on `_lastFoundAtlasChildIndex`; a mid-session mode swap (keyboard ↔ controller) triggers a slow-path rescan when the cached index goes non-signature — normal case is the cache-hit fast path (unchanged perf).

### Upgrade

**Recommended for all controller-mode users.** If you were still seeing "atlas closed" on v0.41.7 despite the atlas being open, this build fixes it directly — no diagnostic-and-diff step required.

## [0.41.7] — 2026-07-18 "Controller-Mode Atlas Diagnostic + Entity Probe"

*Widens the atlas open-detection scan + adds a new `/api/entity-probe` endpoint for offset-drift diagnostics on entities.*

### Added

- 🩺 **New `/api/entity-probe` endpoint** returns per-entity structured samples of the Life + Render component offset sweeps used by the overlay: HP current + max reads, world position reads, and the candidate offsets tried on each. Loopback-Host-gated (raw pointers). Consumers seeing missing HP bars or garbage entity positions can hit this endpoint + share the payload to identify which entity-component offset drifted.

### Fixed

- 🎮 **Controller-mode "atlas closed" false-positive.** Field payload showed my v0.41.5 code correctly finding an 18-child-signature-matching panel at UiRoot index 22 (the historical atlas panel location) but its visible bit reading FALSE despite the atlas being open. Root cause: PoE2's controller UI is structurally a different subsystem from keyboard UI (gamepad-first radial atlas vs. keyboard/mouse atlas), and the true atlas panel for controller mode may sit past the first 60 children my old scan covered.

### Changed

- 🩺 **`atlasProbe` scan window widened** from static 60 → `min(200, actual-child-count)`. UiRoot's real direct-child count is now surfaced as `atlasProbe.totalUiRootChildren` in the payload — readers see "we scanned N of M children" and can request wider coverage if needed.
- 🩺 **New `atlasProbe.signatureMatches` array** reports every scanned index whose child count falls in the `[8, 30]` signature window AND its current visible bit. Format: `"index=22 childCount=18 visible=false"`. Hit `/api/atlas` twice (atlas open + atlas closed) and diffing this array reveals which index's visible flag flips — that's the true atlas panel for the current UI mode.

### Under the hood

- New `EntityProbeSample` sealed record (7 positional fields: EntityAddr / RenderAddr / LifeAddr / HpCurCurrentOffset / HpMaxCurrentOffset / LifeHealthSweep / RenderPositionSweep) + `Poe2Live.ProbeEntities(int maxSamples = 5)` method sample up to 5 tracked entities from the render loop's caches.
- `AtlasProbeInfo` record struct grows from 11 → 13 positional fields (added `SignatureMatchingCandidates` + `TotalUiRootChildren` appended so existing JSON consumers don't miss fields).
- 27 new xUnit reflection facts across `EntityProbeSampleTests` + `AtlasProbeInfoTests` lock both records' positional shapes so future refactors can't silently break `/api/entity-probe` + `/api/atlas` consumers.

### Upgrade

Recommended for anyone still seeing "atlas closed" despite the atlas being open — especially controller-mode users. Also useful for any support conversation about missing HP bars or garbage entity positions (the new `/api/entity-probe` endpoint gives me actionable diagnostic).

## [0.41.5] — 2026-07-17 "Atlas Detection — Deep Probe"

*Field diagnostic: v0.41.4 confirmed the atlas scan is short-circuiting on a null Children pointer. This drop adds a raw-offset sweep so we can see which offset the game patch shifted `UiElement.Children` to.*

### Changed

- 🩺 **`/api/atlas` `atlasProbe` field is now much richer.** Adds `uiRootAddr`, `childrenBeginAddr`, `childrenEndAddr` (raw pointers so you can see whether we short-circuited on `uiRoot == 0` vs `children == 0`), `childrenOffsetHex` / `childrenEndOffsetHex` (the offsets we tried), and `probeAtOffsets` — a sweep of 10 plausible offsets around the current 0x10 with what each reads back (`0x18=0x7ffe1234 (18 slots)` or `0x18=null`). The offset that shows a non-null pointer with a reasonable slot count is where the atlas panel Children StdVector actually lives now.

### Under the hood

- New `Poe2Atlas.SweepChildrenCandidateOffsets(uiRoot)` — reads `*(uiRoot + off)` for `off` in `{0x00, 0x08, 0x10, 0x18, 0x20, 0x28, 0x30, 0x38, 0x40, 0x48}` and reports each result as a compact string.
- `LastProbe` is populated even on early-return so field diagnostics are never blank.

### Upgrade

Recommended for anyone still seeing "atlas closed" after v0.41.4. Paste your `/api/atlas` response back and I'll pin down the new offset.

## [0.41.4] — 2026-07-17 "Atlas Detection — Wider Scan"

*v0.41.3's ±6 / exact-18-children window still missed the patch-day drift for some users. Wider now.*

### Fixed

- 🗺 **Atlas open-detection now scans all first 60 UiRoot children** (up from ±6 around index 22) and accepts child count in [8, 30] as the panel signature (previously required exact 18). The 2026-07-16 game patch appears to have restructured the atlas panel itself (new child count), not just its parent index — the exact-18 signature failed for candidates the widened scan would otherwise have found.
- 🩺 **New `atlasProbe` field on `/api/atlas`** exposes the primary index, cached auto-discovered index, chosen index, chosen visibility bit, and the child-count histogram of the first 60 UiRoot children. Users still seeing false "atlas closed" can copy-paste that payload and I can pin down where the panel drifted to.

### Under the hood

- `Poe2Atlas.LastProbe` publishes the most recent scan's diagnostic snapshot; `RadarApp.AtlasJson()` includes it in the /api/atlas response body.

### Upgrade

Recommended if v0.41.3 still shows "atlas closed" despite the atlas being open. Share the `atlasProbe.childCounts` array if it still misses.

## [0.41.3] — 2026-07-17 "Atlas Detection Fix"

*The web UI wrongly said "atlas closed" for anyone whose UI child structure drifted with the 2026-07-16 game patch. Auto-recovers now.*

### Fixed

- 🗺 **Atlas open-detection auto-recovers from UI child-index drift.** The atlas panel lives at `UiRoot` child index 22 (validated 2026-06-08); today's game patch (same one v0.40.1 chased for AreaInstance offsets) shifted UI children on some setups so index 22 no longer points at it — result: "atlas closed — open it in-game + Refresh" even when the atlas is wide open. Fix: `AtlasPanelOpen()` now checks the 18-child signature at the primary index, and if it doesn't match, scans ±6 neighbor indices for the panel. First success is cached; subsequent calls hit the fast path. Fail-safe: still degrades to "closed" if the panel truly isn't findable (no per-tick BFS).

### Upgrade

Recommended if you saw "atlas closed" reported despite having the atlas open in-game.

## [0.41.2] — 2026-07-17 "Scrollable Tabstrip"

*Fix for the v0.41.0 tabstrip overflow.*

### Fixed

- 📜 **Dashboard tabstrip now scrolls horizontally** on narrow viewports. v0.41.0 added four new tabs (Radar Filter / Layouts / Nav / Widget) that pushed the strip past the visible edge for anyone whose dashboard window was narrower than ~1900px, hiding the newest tabs entirely with no way to reach them. Fix: `overflow-x: auto` + `white-space: nowrap` + a subtle 6px scrollbar (thin scrollbar-color variant on Firefox, styled `::-webkit-scrollbar` on Chromium). Scroll with shift-wheel, trackpad, or the scrollbar. Tab labels stay fully readable — no ellipsis-truncation.

### Upgrade

Recommended for everyone on v0.41.0 / v0.41.1 whose window doesn't fit the full 15-tab strip.

## [0.41.1] — 2026-07-17 "Ops Hotfix"

*Supporter roster nudge — no user-visible functional change.*

### Changed

- 🔑 Expanded the embedded supporter-code roster with one additional entry — restores a code that missed initial delivery. Anyone on v0.41.0 without a supporter code sees zero change; anyone whose delivered code was affected can now paste it and unlock the supporter tier as intended.

### Upgrade

Optional for most users. Recommended only if you're the specific supporter waiting on a re-delivered code.

## [0.41.0] — 2026-07-17 "Supporter Bundle"

*Focused play. Your loadout follows your zone.*

### Added — 🎯 **Four supporter-tier features** *(free tier byte-identical to v0.40.1)*

- 🎯 **Focused Radar Filter** — per-zone whitelist / blacklist. Blacklist entities skip the render walk entirely (real FPS win in town: a hideout with 40 decorative NPCs / vendor pets / critters now costs zero draw time). Configurable via a new **Radar Filter** tab in Settings with per-preset match pattern (glob: `*_town`, `T17_*`, `Delirium_*`, or exact zone code) + whitelist chips + blacklist chips + add-from-current-zone helper. First-match-wins on zone entry; caps: 20 presets, 50 patterns per list.
- 🧩 **Zone-Aware Overlay Layouts** — save up to 10 dashboard-panel loadouts and let them auto-swap on zone entry. Town preset hides drop timeline + boss HP + XP chart; boss-arena preset hides everything except vitals + boss HP; maps get your full loadout. New **Layouts** tab with capture-current-layout helper (snapshots visible panels into a draft preset). Same wildcard-glob matcher as Radar Filter.
- 📍 **Custom Auto-Nav Destinations** — name any grid position ("chest room at 145,220 in T17-Necropolis"). New **Nav** tab with per-row inline editor + capture-current-position helper (pre-fills zoneCode + coords from `/api/state`). Overlay draws cyan diamond markers with `→ <name>` labels; floating chip strip in top-right shows saved destinations for the current zone. Cap: 50 destinations.
- 📊 **Session Stat Widget** — floating dashboard-chrome widget with 6 configurable chips (drops / XP gained / bosses killed / deaths / time-in-zone / avg-map-clear-time). New **Widget** tab picks which chips render + x/y position. Refreshes every 2s; hidden entirely for non-supporters.

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Support.SupporterGate` static — canonical replacement for the scattered `s.isSupporter` predicate. Existing v0.35 palette gate refactored to use it behind the scenes (user-visible behavior unchanged). JS mirror `window.__supporterGate.isSupporter()` for the 4 UI features + retrofit.
- New `POE2Radar.Core.Zones.ZoneCodeMatcher` static — wildcard-glob matcher (`*_town`, `T17_*`, `*`) reused by A + B for zone-code matching. Case-sensitive, null-safe.
- New `window.__supporterHint` JS component — inline card ("Supporter feature — Save your Ko-fi code in Settings to unlock this.") that renders in the editor's place for non-supporters. Retrofitted into the v0.35 palette-select gate (no more silent-revert UX).
- New `window.__panelInventory` JS helper + 12 stable `data-panel-id` handles on canonical dashboard panels — foundation for Layouts auto-swap (B3) and future Layout Designer work.
- 4 new `POE2Radar.Core.*` stores (RadarFilters / OverlayLayouts / NavDestinations / SessionWidget) — all whole-file `config/*.json` envelopes with atomic `.tmp` + `File.Move` writes, mirroring v0.39 `RulesFileStore` pattern.
- 4 new HTTP endpoint families in `ApiServer.cs` — `/api/radar-filters`, `/api/overlay-layouts`, `/api/nav-destinations` (per-id CRUD + `?zone=` filter), `/api/session-widget` (single-record + bundled `allowedChips` metadata). Loopback-Host-gated writes; standard 400/403/405 semantics.
- Renderer wire-ups: blacklist early-continue in `OverlayRenderer.cs` entity draw loop (saves both `Rules.TryMatch` cost and `EntityView` allocation for skipped entities) + Nav Destination markers drawn after the tile-landmark loop.
- LayoutAutoSwap IIFE polls `/api/state` every 2s; on zone change, GETs `/api/overlay-layouts`, first-matching preset applies via `window.__panelInventory.get(slug)`.
- SessionMetricProviders — 6 pure formatters (CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, thousand-separators, mm:ss / Hh Mm time buckets, em-dash fallback for missing data).

### Tests

- ~230 new xUnit facts across 15 new test files. Full suite grows from **1112 → 1370** (+258 tests, all green, 2 pre-existing SSE skips).

### Upgrade

Fully additive — no config migration. Free-tier experience is byte-identical to v0.40.1. Every supporter feature is dormant until a valid Ko-fi code is present in Settings; when it is, the new tabs light up. Existing v0.35 palette gate keeps working exactly as before (retrofit is behind-the-scenes).

## [0.40.1] — 2026-07-17 "Patch-Day Hotfix"

*Path of Exile 2 shifted five internal offsets today; POE2GPS follows.*

### Fixed — 🔧 **AreaInstance offsets for the 2026-07-16 game patch (+0x8 shift)**

- 🧭 **Reads work again.** Today's Path of Exile 2 patch shifted five fields inside the AreaInstance block by `+0x08`. Without the update, the overlay reads garbage for player position, entity map, terrain grid, and server data — heatmap goes blank, entities disappear, terrain draws wrong. Fixed by merging upstream Sikaka/POE2Radar@2615bec.
- Shifts applied: LocalPlayer `0x5B8→0x5C0`, ServerDataPtr `0x598→0x5A0`, AwakeEntities `0x6D8→0x6E0`, SleepingEntities `0x6E8→0x6F0`, TerrainMetadata `0x8B8→0x8C0`.
- Low-offset fields (AreaInfo/Level/Hash) sit below the insertion and are unchanged.
- Life-component vitals, entity walk, terrain, inventory, and league detect all re-validated upstream against a live 2026-07-16 client session.

### Under the hood

- New `--chaindbg` Research probe: wide-scans the AreaInstance block for the LocalPlayer metadata gate, so future patch-day drift can be localized in seconds instead of manual byte-hunting.
- Doc comments on the AreaInstance layout summary + entity-map / inventory / terrain seams updated to the new offsets to prevent future readers from anchoring on stale values.

### Upgrade

**Recommended for everyone playing today or later.** No config changes; if v0.40.0 is running against today's game patch it will silently misread — grab this build.

## [0.40.0] — 2026-07-17 "Cartographer"

*Every zone you cleared, drawn.*

### Added — 🗺 **Cartographer** *(movement heatmap + route replay)*

- 🗺 **Movement heatmap.** New Cartographer tab in Settings shows which parts of each zone you've walked, colored by density (log-normalized 64×64 grid, transparent→dark-blue→teal→yellow→warm-orange viridis ramp). The tool has been silently sampling your position at 1 Hz since v0.40 launched — run the same map twice and coverage builds up over time.
- ▶️ **Route replay.** Play / Pause / Jump-first / Jump-last controls plus a scrub slider let you replay your movement through any zone you've cleared. Watch where you backtracked, spot side rooms you missed. Speed presets: 1×, 4×, 16×, and Max (roughly 60 samples/sec at 60 FPS — 30 minutes of gameplay replays in ~30 seconds). Timestamp readout stays in sync with the scrub position.
- 🔐 **Loopback-gated `/api/tracks`.** Character-name query is served only to localhost — same privacy posture as v0.37 Codex. Position samples never leave your machine. `/state` continues to strip character identity.
- 🎯 **Additive.** No overlay changes; ignore the tab and nothing about your rig changes. Sample rate is a fixed 1 Hz on the render thread (30× downsampled from the world tick) — cheap enough to leave running forever.
- 💡 **Discoverability card** on the dashboard first-load flags the new feature for existing users. Dismissable with `[×]`; the dismissal persists via `localStorage`.

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Tracks` namespace: `TrackSample` record + `TrackStore` static class handles append/load/list against `config/tracks/<sanitized-character>/<zone-code>.jsonl`. Character-name + zone-code sanitize via the same letter/digit/underscore/hyphen rule as codex + palettes. 10K-sample ring cap with read-rewrite trim keeps the newest 9K on overflow. All exceptions swallowed on the render hot path.
- New `TrackRecorder` — 30-tick character-name stability gate (v0.37 pattern) + 1-Hz `Stopwatch` downsample gate + zone-change clock reset. Wired into RadarApp's per-tick observer next to `SessionEventLog`.
- New `/api/tracks?character=<name>&zone=<code>` (loopback-gated), `/api/tracks/characters`, `/api/tracks/zones?character=<name>` (both also loopback-gated). Non-GET methods return 405.
- New Cartographer dashboard IIFE: cascading character/zone selects → 64×64 density render → offscreen heatmap cache → route dotted-line overlay + gold marker at scrubbed sample index. `requestAnimationFrame` loop drives playback advance.

### Tests

- 51 new xUnit facts across `TrackStoreTests` (16: append/roundtrip/sanitize/ring-cap/perf-under-cadence-budget), `TrackRecorderTests` (9: stability-gate/downsample/zone-change/silent-exception/happy-path), `ApiTracksEndpointTests` (13: 3 routes × gate/missing-param/happy/method), `DashboardCartographerTabTests` (6: HTML/JS/CSS structural), `DashboardCartographerReplayTests` (4: playback controls + speed presets + JS symbols), `DashboardCartographerHintTests` (3: hint card + dismiss). Full suite grows from 1061 to 1112 (all green).

### Known limitations

- **Per-session split** — currently multiple runs of the same zone APPEND to the same track file (density accumulates). A "session filter" UI (view only the last N sessions) is v0.40.1 scope.
- **Overlay heatmap layer** — v1 is dashboard-only. A translucent grid drawn on the actual overlay is v0.41 scope.
- **Export as PNG / GIF** for streaming clip use — v0.40.1.
- **Cross-zone aggregate** ("all your Delirium mirror clears overlaid") — v0.40.1.

### Upgrade

Fully additive — no config migration required. Position sampling starts writing the moment your character name stabilizes; if you don't want it, ignore the new dashboard tab. Existing installs upgrade cleanly.

## [0.39.1] — 2026-07-17 "Ring, Label, Pulse"

*The rest of the effects, wired.*

### Added — 🎨 **Ring, Label, and Pulse effects go live**

- ⭕ **Ring** — outlines the entity with a `#rrggbb`-parsed color at 1.4× the icon radius. Stacks on top of hide/tint from v0.39.0.
- 🏷 **Label** — overrides the entity's default label with your custom text. Four token expansions: `{name}` (entity token), `{level}` (entity level), `{metadata}` (full metadata path), `{zone}` (current area code). Unknown tokens are left as literal `{foo}` — never crashes.
- 💓 **Pulse** — alpha modulation on the entity's brush. `slow` = 1 Hz (breathing), `fast` = 3 Hz (heartbeat). Alpha bounded to [0.4, 1.0] so entities never disappear entirely mid-pulse. Composes with tint (pulse alpha applies to whatever color the entity ends up with).

**Sound** remains deferred — needs an audio playback subsystem with first-sight dedup + WAV file resolution from `config/sounds/`. Sound-effect rules save + load fine today; they just don't play yet.

### Under the hood

- `RuleEffectApplier` gains 3 new pure helpers: `HasEffect<T>(effects, out T?)` generic lookup, `ExpandLabelTokens(template, EntityView, WorldSnapshotView)` deterministic substitution, `ApplyPulseAlpha(baseColor, PulseEffect, elapsedMs)` = `0.7 + 0.3·sin(2π·hz·t)` mapped to [0.4, 1.0].
- `OverlayRenderer` gains a `_renderStopwatch` field (single Stopwatch.StartNew for the app lifetime) that feeds elapsedMs to the pulse calculation. Entity draw loop applies pulse alpha before tint override, then draws icon, then draws ring outline as a DrawEllipse with the brush color restored afterward, then uses `effectiveLabel = LabelEffect.Text` expanded (or falls back to `rule.Label`) for the label draw.

### Tests

- 35 new xUnit facts in `RuleEffectApplierTests` (total grows 16 → 51): HasEffect for each of 3 kinds present/missing, all 4 label tokens plus unknown/empty edge cases, pulse alpha at slow/fast × start/mid/end waypoints, alpha boundedness. Full suite grows from 1026 to 1061 (all green).

### Upgrade

Fully additive. Rules authored in v0.39.0 that used Ring/Label/Pulse effects (which persisted through Save/Load but were inert on the overlay) now render as intended without any config change.

## [0.39.0] — 2026-07-16 "Rule Engine"

*One place. One schema. One Save.*

### Added — 🎛 **The Rule Engine** *(unified when-selector → then-effects[] pipeline)*

- 🎛 **New "Rule Engine" tab in Settings.** Every rule is `when this matches, then do this`. Selectors filter by metadata regex, entity token, rarity, zone code, in-hideout flag, level range, or buff presence — any combination, flat AND (v1.1 will add nested boolean logic). Effects: **hide** (force-suppress the entity), **tint** (`#rrggbb` color override), **ring** (outline — deferred to v0.39.1), **label** (custom text with `{name}`/`{level}`/`{metadata}`/`{zone}` tokens — v0.39.1), **sound** (WAV file — v0.39.1), **pulse** (slow/fast — v0.39.1). v1.0 ships **hide** + **tint** live end-to-end; the other effect types persist through Save/Load but are inert on the overlay until R3.1 wires them.
- 🔄 **Composable priority + enabled toggle.** Higher priority wins conflicts; toggle any rule on/off without deleting it. Save → apply live on next entity tick — no restart, no page reload.
- 🚪 **Legacy migration on demand.** Existing Affix Nameplates / Buff Nameplates / Rules (item filter) tabs each get a `Migrate to Rule Engine →` button that opens the Rules Engine editor pre-filled with a starting-point rule derived from that tab. Original legacy rule stays put — you review + Save the new one; delete the legacy source manually when confident.
- 📮 **Share-code roadmap.** Rule sharing (paste-safe RUNE1-style codes like v0.38 palettes) is planned for v0.39.1 — v1.0 ships local-only.
- 🛡 **Fully additive.** All six legacy rule surfaces (AffixNameplates, BuffNameplates, WaystoneRedFlags, AutoNav, AtlasTags, CustomLandmarks, ItemFilterEngine) continue to work byte-identically. The new engine is opt-in. Ignore the new tab and nothing changes about how the overlay behaves for you.

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Rules` namespace: `RulesFile` envelope + `RuleRecord` (id/name/priority/enabled/when/then) + `Selector` (8 optional predicates) + polymorphic `Effect` base with 6 sealed subtypes (HideEffect/TintEffect/RingEffect/LabelEffect/SoundEffect/PulseEffect). `[JsonPolymorphic]` + `[property: JsonIgnore]` discriminator per the v0.37 CodexEvent pattern.
- New `RulesFileStore` static class: Load/Save/Upsert/Delete/ValidateRule against `config/rules.json` (whole-file atomic-rename envelope, NOT JSONL). Strict slug/hex/rarity/speed/sound-name validation; 100-rule cap enforced at Save.
- New `RuleEngine.Compile(RulesFile)` → `CompiledRuleSet.TryMatch(EntityView, WorldSnapshotView) → IReadOnlyList<Effect>`. Regex pre-compiled with `Compiled | IgnoreCase | CultureInvariant`; rules sorted by descending priority; TryMatch never throws (compile-time validation catches all).
- New `RuleEffectApplier` helper: `HexToColor4("#rrggbb") → Color4` + `TryApply(effects, ref Color4) → bool hide`. Used inline by `OverlayRenderer` in the entity draw loop; exported public + tested for future R3.1 wire-up sites.
- New `/api/rules` HttpListener routes in `ApiServer.cs`: `GET` list ungated, `GET/POST/DELETE` by id, `POST` 409-on-duplicate-name, all writes loopback-Host-gated. Mirrors the v0.38 F1 `/api/palettes` pattern.
- New `OverlayRenderer.Rules` + `ItemFilterEngine.Rules` public properties, defaulting to `RuleEngine.Empty` (safe null pattern — no rule effects apply until loaded). `RadarApp` loads + compiles on startup via silent try/catch (malformed `rules.json` can't crash startup).

### Tests

- 89 new xUnit facts across `RulesFileStoreTests` (19: round-trip, cap, invalid hex/rarity/sound-name), `RuleEngineTests` (25: every predicate × effect combo, perf bench 100 rules × 10K iterations @ 0.02ms/call avg), `ApiRulesEndpointTests` (13: CRUD, 403/404/409/400/500 semantics), `DashboardRulesTabTests` (6: structural — tab button, editor ids, JS symbols), `RuleEffectApplierTests` (16: hex parsing + effect application), `ItemFilterEngineRuleFilterTests` (6: pass-through, Hide filters, TintEffect no-op, disabled skip), `DashboardRulesMigrationTests` (4: migrate-button presence + prefill-event listener). Full suite grows from 937 to 1026 (all green).

### Known limitations

- **Ring / label / sound / pulse** effects persist through Save/Load but don't render on the overlay yet. Follow-up bead R3.1 wires them in v0.39.1.
- **Nested selector boolean logic** (`not:` / `any:` / `all:` wrappers) — flat AND only in v1.0. v1.1 based on user feedback.
- **Live match count** ("matches ~N of last 100 entities") — deferred to v0.39.1 to keep R5's dashboard tab tractable.
- **Legacy migration** copies one representative rule per tab, not full auto-migration of every legacy rule. User reviews + Saves the migrated draft; original legacy rule stays put.
- **Buff-based selectors** don't fire on filter-path (only on renderer-path) because `ItemFilterEngine` doesn't have world-snapshot context at Match-time — selectors that check `zoneCode`/`inHideout`/`hasBuff` are renderer-only.

### Upgrade

Fully additive — no config migration required. Every existing settings file, filter, and rule works unchanged. `config/rules.json` starts empty; the new tab is inert until you author your first rule.

## [0.38.0] — 2026-07-16 "The Forge"

*Ten built-in palettes was a start. Now you make your own.*

### Added — 🔨 **The Color Forge**

- 🎨 **Full 13-var color designer** in Settings → Color Forge. Every dashboard CSS variable — --gold, --gold-bright, --gold-deep, --ink, --ink-dim, --ink-faint, --panel, --panel2, --bg, --bg-alt, --line, --line-soft, --good — gets its own row with HSL sliders + hex text input, kept in bidirectional sync (drag the slider, the hex updates; type a hex, the sliders snap). Invalid hex marks the input .invalid; the rest of the palette keeps working.
- 🖼 **Live sample preview** shows a mock kill-card, drop-card, vitals bar, chart, button, and tooltip using the values you're dialing in. Preview is scoped to its own `<div>` via `--fp-*` vars — the applied dashboard palette doesn't change until you hit Save, so you can experiment without wrecking your current look.
- 💾 **Save / Load / Delete presets** via a Name field + Save button + Load-from dropdown. Presets persist to `config/palettes/<slug>.json` (13 vars + preview thumbnail auto-derived from `[--bg, --panel, --gold, --ink]`). Slug validation: `^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$`, the 10 built-in slugs are reserved. Duplicate-name Save returns 409 Conflict — never silent overwrite.
- 🎯 **Presets appear in the palette dropdown + chip strip** immediately after Save — no reload needed. Selected user palette persists via the same settings flow as the built-ins. Same supporter-gate logic: user palettes are supporter-only, same as the built-ins.

### Added — 📮 **Share codes** *(paste-safe color exchange)*

- 📤 **Copy current** encodes whatever palette is rendering right now into a `RUNE1-<base64url>-<crc6>` wire string and puts it on your clipboard. Reads live computed CSS vars, so it captures built-ins AND Forge presets AND imports identically.
- 📥 **Import pasted** decodes a RUNE1 code from the textarea, applies it to `<body>` via a dedicated `<style id="importedPaletteStyles">` block, and persists to `localStorage['poe2gps.importedPalette']` as a single slot (overwrite on each import). Survives page reload without re-import.
- 🛡 **FNV-1a checksum** on the last 6 hex chars catches paste corruption before decode — malformed codes silently return null rather than half-applying a broken palette.
- ♻ **Want to keep an imported palette?** Import it, then open the Forge, name it, and hit Save. Import lives in localStorage until overwritten; Save turns it into a real preset in `config/palettes/`.

### Added — 🖼 **Preset Gallery**

- 🖼 **Thumbnail grid of the 10 built-in palettes** in the Settings tab, one card per palette with a 4-swatch mini-preview + display name. Swatches read live from the CSS palette blocks (no hardcoded hex map to drift), so any palette CSS tweak reflects in the gallery automatically.
- 🔀 **Clone button** on each card forks that palette into the Forge editor pre-populated with its 13 vars + a suggested name (`<slug>-fork`). Save it under a new name and you've got a variant. Fastest way to riff on an existing look.

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Palettes.UserPalette` sealed record + `UserPaletteStore` static class handles read/list/save/delete against `config/palettes/`. Strict slug + hex validation at the store layer, not the API layer, so shell-level tinkering (dropping a file directly) still enforces the invariants.
- New `/api/palettes` HttpListener routes in `ApiServer.cs`: `GET` list is open (needed by the dashboard chip strip), `POST`/`DELETE` are loopback-Host-gated (writes never happen from a non-localhost origin). Duplicate-name `POST` returns `409 Conflict`.
- New `paletteCodec.js` module: self-contained encode/decode with FNV-1a-32 checksum, exposed as `window.__paletteCodec = {encode, decode, MAGIC, KEYS}`. C# mirror in `PaletteCodecTests.cs` asserts byte-for-byte parity — decode a JS-encoded string, and vice versa.
- `dashboard.js`: new ColorForge IIFE + Preset Gallery renderer + Share/Import IIFE + user-palettes-changed CustomEvent dispatch/listen. Shared `_userPalettesPromise` cache serves both the `<select>` refresh and the preview chip strip from a single `GET /api/palettes` on load, invalidated on save/delete.
- `dashboard.css`: `.forge-panel`, `.forge-row`, `.forge-preview`, `.forge-preset-card`, `.palette-share` blocks. Preview vars scoped to `#forgePreview` via `--fp-*` custom-property names so authoring never leaks into the applied palette.
- `dashboard.html`: new `<style id="user-palette-styles">` block populated at runtime with `body[data-palette="user-<slug>"]{...}` rules — the same selector shape as the built-in palette blocks, so user palettes drop into the existing CSS pipeline without a code-path fork.

### Tests

- 40+ new xUnit facts across `UserPaletteStoreTests` (round-trip, list, delete, reserved-slug rejection, invalid-hex rejection, preview auto-derivation), `PaletteCodecTests` (round-trip, hex-lower normalization, corrupt-input handling, 8KB decoded cap, JS/C# parity), `DashboardPalettePreviewTests` (extended to allow user-<slug> keys via regex), `DashboardForgePresetGalleryTests` (HTML container, CSS selectors, JS symbols, no hardcoded hex map), `DashboardForgeCloneTests` (Clone button wiring). Full suite grows from 925 to 937 (all green).

### Upgrade

Fully additive. Existing installs upgrade cleanly, no config migration. Every existing built-in palette + supporter code + settings file works unchanged. If you don't want any of this, ignore the new "Color Forge" and "Preset Gallery" widgets in Settings; the classic dropdown still works exactly as before.

## [0.37.0] — 2026-07-16 "Book of the Exile"

*Every character's story, written as it happens.*

### Added — 📓 **Character Codex** *(per-character auto-written journal)*

- 📓 **Every character keeps a running book.** POE2GPS quietly writes four event kinds to `config/codex/<character>.jsonl` in real time as you play: 🌟 level-ups (captured at the exact tick your character advances), 🐉 boss kills (attributed via `BossEncounterCatalog` with strict allowlist — unknown uniques never logged), 💀 deaths (with zone + area level + character level at moment of death), 💎 notable drops (unique-rarity items on first sighting per character).
- 🛡 **Character-name stability gate** — 30 ticks of unchanged `PlayerName` at 30 Hz world-tick cadence before a codex file opens. Prevents opening for the wrong character during the login/character-swap flicker window. Swap characters mid-session and the codex swaps files cleanly after the new name settles.
- 🧭 **Strict allowlist attribution** — the boss observer only logs a `BossKillEvent` when the dying entity's `Metadata` (or its zone `AreaCode`) resolves via `BossEncounterCatalog.Shared`. Unknown uniques are silently dropped rather than logged as "unknown boss," keeping the codex clean of noise.
- ♻ **Per-character dedup for drops** — the same unique dropping twice in one session for one character is logged once. A different character on the same account gets its own first-sighting entry.

### Added — 📚 **Dashboard Codex tab**

- 📚 **New Codex tab in the dashboard.** Renders your character's book with per-day chapter groupings, per-kind filter chips (level / boss / death / drop), and jump-to-date shortcuts (Today / Yesterday / This Week).
- 🔌 **New `GET /api/codex?character=<name>` endpoint** — loopback-Host-gated because the character-name query parameter would otherwise leak past your machine. `/state` continues to strip character identity, preserving the existing privacy posture. Returns 400 on missing `character`, 403 for non-loopback, 200 with `{ events: [] }` for unknown characters.

### Under the hood

- New `POE2Radar.Core.Session.CodexEvent` polymorphic type hierarchy with JSONL round-trip via `System.Text.Json` `[JsonPolymorphic]` (abstract base + `LevelUpEvent`, `BossKillEvent`, `DeathEvent`, `NotableDropEvent` sealed records).
- New `SessionEventLog` mirrors DropTimeline's mature load-on-construct + append + flush-on-dispose seams, adds character-name stability gating and stateless per-character reads (`SnapshotForCharacter`) for cross-character API queries without disturbing live tracking.
- New `CodexBossObserver` hooks the render-thread world-tick per-entity walk next to `ObserveKill`, using an alive→dead edge detector on unique-rarity mobs plus `BossEncounterCatalog.ByMetadata` / `ByZoneCode` for gating.
- New `CodexDropForwarder` subscribes to a new `DropTimeline.Recorded` event (fires after each `DropEntry` add, outside the lock to avoid reentrancy). Existing `DropTimeline` consumers unaffected.
- `SessionTracker` gains a public `event Action<CodexEvent>? CodexEmit`, fires `LevelUpEvent` on player-level delta and `DeathEvent` at the HP-observed-above-zero + `!_awaitingRespawn` edge (same site as `_deaths++`). Null-sink default so existing tests / production paths behave byte-identically.
- `RadarApp` wires all four sinks + observers into runtime state; feeds `snap.PlayerName` into `SessionEventLog.ObservePlayerName` each fresh world tick.

### Tests

- 57 new xUnit facts across `CodexEventTests` (polymorphic serialization + JSONL contract), `SessionEventLogTests` (stability-gate + character swap + ring cap + corrupt-line recovery + polymorphic round-trip), `SessionTrackerCodexEmitTests`, `CodexBossObserverTests`, `CodexDropForwarderTests`, `ApiCodexEndpointTests`, and `CodexDashboardMarkupTests`. Full suite grows from 861 to 918 (all green).

### Known limitation

The **boss-attribution validation test** (D1 — a playtest-derived xUnit theory that asserts zero false positives on ~30 non-boss uniques against `BossEncounterCatalog`) will ship in **v0.37.1** once metadata paths are captured from a live PoE2 session. The runtime attribution logic is already strict-allowlist (unknown uniques dropped silently), so the risk of false-positive boss entries in codex writes is low; the follow-up formalizes the guarantee.

### Upgrade

Fully additive — no config migration, nothing you have to change. Existing installs upgrade cleanly. The codex starts writing the moment your character name stabilizes; if you don't want it, ignore the new dashboard tab and never look in `config/codex/`.

## [0.36.1] — 2026-07-16 "First Light"

*The starter pack lights itself on first run — the v0.36.0 promise, delivered.*

### Fixed — 📦 **Starter pack auto-activates on first run** *(closes the v0.36.0 known limitation)*

- 🕯 **Fresh installs now light up automatically.** On startup — before `OverlayRenderer` builds `IconRegistry` — `RadarApp` calls `EmbeddedStarterIconExtractor.EnsureExtracted(config/icons/)`, which unpacks all 20 bundled icons (both 32 and 64 px sizes), `mapping.json`, and `ATTRIBUTION.md` verbatim from the embedded `POE2Radar.Overlay.StarterIcons.*` resources. No more "copy the files out of the DLL" step.
- 🛡 **User config always wins.** If `config/icons/` already contains any user file, the extractor returns `SkipReason="user-files-present"` and touches nothing. Your custom pack is never overwritten.
- ♻ **Idempotent.** Once the pack is on disk it counts as "user files" from the extractor's point of view, so the guard trips on every subsequent launch — no re-extraction, no churn.
- 🔎 **Support-diagnostic ExtractResult.** `(bool Extracted, int FileCount, string? SkipReason)` is logged on startup so a broken install can be triaged from the log without exposing internals to end users.

### Tests

- 5 new xUnit facts covering the missing-directory, empty-directory, user-files-present (PNG), user-files-present (`mapping.json`), and idempotency paths.

### Upgrade

Fully additive. Existing installs with a populated `config/icons/` see zero change — the extractor no-ops when it detects your files. Empty or missing `config/icons/` now lights up with the bundled 20-icon pack on the next launch instead of rendering like v0.35. No settings change, no migration.

## [0.36.0] — 2026-07-16 "Illumination"

*Hand-painted icons come to the map.*

### Added — 🖼 **Custom Entity Icons** *(drop PNGs into `config/icons/`, both surfaces wear your art)*

- 🎨 **The vector dot is now a textured quad.** Drop PNGs into `config/icons/` and every entity — monsters, stashes, waypoints, NPCs, chests, the lot — swaps its overlay marker for your art. Same source folder skins both the D2D overlay and the browser `/map` view, so the two never drift out of sync.
- 🗂 **Precedence goes metadata glob → category+rarity → category → default.** Surgical overrides never fight your defaults — pin a specific monster metadata id to one PNG without disturbing the rest of its category. Nested `categories.rarity` schema is the new form; legacy flat `mapping.json` files continue to load unchanged.
- 🌈 **`IconTintByRarity` toggle in the dashboard Settings panel** — flip it on to lay a translucent rarity halo behind each icon (Unique ochre, Rare yellow, Magic blue, Normal grey), so monster tier still reads at a glance even with custom art on top. Defaults to on.
- ♻ **Hot-reload from `config/icons/`.** Edit a PNG or `mapping.json` and the overlay + web map pick it up within ~250 ms — save-and-see loop, no restart. Backed by a `FileSystemWatcher` in the new `IconRegistry` with an atomic snapshot + monotonic `SnapshotVersion` so mid-refresh reads never tear.

### Added — ✒ **Starter Pack — 20 hand-drawn icons, bundled in** *(CC BY 3.0, [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net))*

- 📦 **Twenty CC BY 3.0 icons ship embedded inside the DLL** at both 32 and 64 pixel sizes, with a canonical `mapping.json.default` that binds them across every entity category out of the box. Black-line on transparent so the overlay's rarity tint recolors them cleanly at draw time.
- 🖋 **Attribution — [Lorc](https://lorcblog.blogspot.com/) and [Delapouite](https://delapouite.com/) via [game-icons.net](https://game-icons.net), CC BY 3.0.** Full per-file attribution ships alongside the pack in `assets/starter-icons/ATTRIBUTION.md`, and a build-time verify step gates every icon on a matching credit line so nothing ships unattributed.
- 🧭 **Zero-config default mapping** — categories → filenames pinned in `mapping.json.default` so the pack works the instant the runtime hook lights up. Skull for monsters, chest for stashes, compass for waypoints, and so on down the entity table.

### Added — 🌐 **Web map parity** *(browser view mirrors the overlay, driven by the same manifest)*

- 🔌 **New `GET /api/user-icons` manifest endpoint** — enumerates every user icon under `config/icons/` (name, category, rarity, size, hash), ETagged with the `IconRegistry.SnapshotVersion` so the browser's conditional GET short-circuits on 304 until the next hot-reload bumps the counter.
- 🖼 **`/map` preloads the manifest and swaps at draw time.** `loadUserIcons()` fetches once at page load and again on `SnapshotVersion` bump; `drawEntities()` walks the same precedence chain the overlay does and calls `drawImage` instead of the old dot fill. Rarity tint applies via a pre-draw halo pass under the sprite, matching the overlay's compositing order.

### Fixed — 🗺 **Server-side hideout detection via AreaCode prefix** *(v0.35 S4 follow-up)*

- 🏠 Hideout detection moved from name-substring matching to `AreaCode`-prefix matching. No user-visible behavior change — just fewer false positives on maps whose display name happens to contain a hideout keyword. Streams the Stream-Safe hideout-coord blur off the authoritative signal.

### Under the hood

- New `Poe2Radar.Core.Icons.IconRegistry` — atomic snapshot record (`ImmutableDictionary<string, IconEntry>` + monotonic `SnapshotVersion`), `FileSystemWatcher` on `config/icons/` with a 250 ms debounce coalescing burst edits into one snapshot swap. Match resolver walks metadata-glob → category+rarity → category → default in a single pass.
- New `EntityIconCache` between `IconRegistry` and the D2D renderer — lazy-uploads PNGs to `Vortice.Direct2D1.ID2D1Bitmap` on first draw, keyed by `(SnapshotVersion, iconId)` so a hot-reload invalidates cleanly without leaking GPU handles. `OverlayRenderer` swaps the legacy `FillEllipse` path for a textured `DrawBitmap` quad, with the rarity halo drawn as a translucent circle in the same pass when `IconTintByRarity` is on.
- `RadarSettings.IconTintByRarity` field (defaults `true`) round-trips through `/api/settings` and merges in on first read of older settings files — no migration, forward-compatible.
- Starter pack embedded as `.resx` resources under `Poe2Radar.Core.Icons.StarterPack.*`; `Poe2Radar.Research --verify-icon-attribution` gates CI on a matching `assets/starter-icons/ATTRIBUTION.md` credit line per shipped file.
- `/api/user-icons` handler emits the `SnapshotVersion` as a strong ETag; conditional-request short-circuit sits directly on the registry snapshot pointer so 304s cost one atomic read.
- New `dashboard.js` `loadUserIcons()` + `drawEntities()` sprite-swap path — preload once, refetch on `SnapshotVersion` bump surfaced via the existing SSE settings stream.

### Known limitation — starter pack auto-extract lands in v0.36.x

The starter pack ships **embedded inside the DLL** in v0.36.0, but the auto-extract-on-first-run wiring is landing in a v0.36.x patch. Until then, to light up icons today either drop your own PNGs into `config/icons/`, or copy the bundled starter files out of the DLL into that folder. If `config/icons/` doesn't exist or is empty, the overlay and web map render exactly like v0.35 — no visual change, no breakage.

### Tests

- 38 new xUnit facts across `IconRegistry` (snapshot atomicity, hot-reload debounce, precedence chain, glob matching, corrupt-mapping tolerance), `EntityIconCache` (upload keying, hot-reload invalidation), `/api/user-icons` (payload shape, ETag round-trip, 304 short-circuit), `RadarSettings.IconTintByRarity` round-trip, the starter-pack attribution verifier, and the server-side hideout `AreaCode`-prefix classifier. Test suite green.

### Upgrade

Fully additive — existing installs upgrade cleanly with no config migration. `RadarSettings` gains one new field (`IconTintByRarity`, defaulting to `true`) which merges in on first read; older settings files are forward-compatible. `/api/user-icons` is a new endpoint; no existing endpoint changed shape. The nested `categories.rarity` `mapping.json` schema is the new form, but legacy flat mapping files continue to load unchanged. If `config/icons/` doesn't exist or is empty, the overlay and web map look identical to v0.35.

## [0.35.0] — 2026-07-15 "Chromatic"

*Your colors, from picker to PNG — and a safe stage to wear them on.*

### Added — 🎨 **Signature Palette Pack** *(8 new Gold-tier cosmetic palettes + live preview)*

- 🎨 **Eight new Gold-tier palettes** — Ultimatum Red, Sanctum Cream, Necropolis Amethyst, Delirium Static, Legion Bronze, Ritual Blood, Trial Ordeal, Blight Bloom. Pick one that matches your stream's brand or your favorite league, wear it between runs.
- 🔲 **Live swatch strip under the Settings picker** — every palette renders its full 8-tone band right below the dropdown, so you see the skin before you wear it instead of guessing from a name.
- 🖼 **Recap PNG now dresses in your active palette.** The shareable end-of-session render pulls its header, accent, and border colors from the same palette your dashboard is running — post one to Discord and it already reads as yours, no manual editing to match your brand.
- 🔌 **`/api/settings` now exposes `paletteColors`** — the resolved color set for the active palette rides on the settings payload, so the recap renderer (and any future OBS overlay skinning) consumes the same source of truth as the dashboard CSS.
- 🧪 **Palette conformance lock** — every palette is contract-tested for slug shape, CSS variable coverage, and HTML class parity, so a future palette drop can't ship half-wired.

### Added — 📡 **Stream-Safe Overlay** *(anti-snipe browser source for on-air runs)*

- 📡 **New `/obs?mode=safe` browser source** — add it as your OBS scene source and go live without handing snipers your next map, your hideout coords, or the rare mob you're about to fight. All the protections below wire in automatically; no scene-editor gymnastics.
- ⏱ **Configurable delay ring buffer (default 30s)** — a client-side FIFO in the map view holds each zone update for the delay window before painting, so what viewers see always trails what you see. Tune the window in Settings.
- 🕶 **Zone-name masking + hideout-coord blur** — current-zone text is masked and hideout coordinates are blurred on the safe view, so a screenshot of your stream can't be used to walk your instance.
- 🌫 **Optional entity-name fog** — off by default, flip it on and entity name labels get fogged on the safe overlay while remaining crisp on your local `/map` view.
- ⚙️ **New RadarSettings fields round-trip through `/api/settings`** — every safe-mode toggle persists across restarts and syncs to the dashboard like every other setting.

### Fixed — 🗺 **Atlas honesty** *(the atlas panel tells you the truth now)*

- 🚨 **Real `/api/atlas` failure state surfaces to the dashboard** — when the endpoint actually fails, the atlas card now shows the error text instead of sitting on a silent "scanning…" spinner forever. You find out something is wrong the moment it goes wrong.
- ♾ **`AtlasAutoRouteMaxHops = 0` round-trips as "unlimited"** — power users who set 0 no longer get silently clamped back to 32 on the next save. If you were relying on 0 as a workaround, it now actually sticks.

### Also included from v0.34 (previously unreleased)

- 🎛 **Dashboard console for atlas + advanced-strip toggles** — 4 atlas behavior toggles (`atlasShowRoute`, `atlasAutoRoute`, `atlasShowBiomeBorder`, `atlasAutoRouteMaxHops`) plus 3 v0.32-Advanced settings (`enableDropTimeline`, `enableItemFilterLiveCounters`, `enableInventoryHighlights`) surface directly in the Settings panel — no more hand-editing `RadarSettings.json` to tune atlas behavior.
- 📸 **Save Session PNG button on the main dashboard** — the shareable end-of-session recap render is now one click from the dashboard, not just from the `/obs` view.

### Tests

- 39 new xUnit facts across the palette contract, safe-mode helpers, recap palette map, and atlas plumbing. Test suite grows accordingly, full green.

### Upgrade

Fully additive drop — no config changes, no migrations, no user action needed. Existing palettes, radar settings, and recap layouts carry over untouched. The new Signature palettes remain gated to Gold-tier supporters as with the existing cosmetic pack. Stream-Safe is opt-in via the new `/obs?mode=safe` URL, so your current `/obs` browser source keeps behaving exactly as it does today.

## [0.33.0] — 2026-07-13 "Ledger"

### Added — 📒 **Drop Timeline** *(persistent per-session record of your ground drops)*

- 📒 **Every non-white ground drop you observe gets logged** to `config/drop_timeline.json` while `EnableDropTimeline` is on. Name, rarity, zone, character, timestamp. Ring-buffered at 1000 entries — oldest drop off first once you saturate. In-memory dedup by entity id keeps the same drop from being recorded twice per session.
- 🗂 **New "Drops" dashboard tab** shows the log in reverse-chronological order — each drop is a rarity-colored card (Unique ochre, Rare yellow, Magic blue, Normal grey) with the item name, its zone, and a live "Xs ago / Xm ago / Xh ago" timestamp. Refreshes on tab open.
- 🔌 **`GET /api/drops` endpoint** exposes the same snapshot as JSON — feeds the dashboard and is available for OBS overlays or scripts. Empty envelope when the tracker isn't running.
- 🛡 **Compliance-first design** — same posture as the v0.30 Boss Wipe Log: local file only, no telemetry, no market pricing, no egress. Compliance-clean respec of the "historical price sparkline" idea from the v1.0 roadmap.
- ⚙️ **Off by default.** Flip `EnableDropTimeline` in `settings.json` to opt in for the persistent file — same convention as `EnableGearScorer` and `EnableItemFilterLiveCounters`.

### Added — 📸 **Session Recap PNG** *(one-click shareable 1920×1080 render on /obs)*

- 📸 **Floating "Save Session PNG" button** appears in the bottom-right of the `/obs` view (only there — never on `/map`). Click it and the browser renders a 1920×1080 canvas of your current session — character level, kills / rare kills / unique kills, deaths, maps per hour, XP per hour, zones entered, session length — laid out with a dark backdrop, a header stripe, and the github footer.
- 🖱 **One-click download** as `poe2gps-session-<timestamp>.png`. Drag into Discord, Twitter, Reddit. Substrate is the SSE session block already flowing — the recap improves automatically as more session stats land upstream.
- 🎯 **Zero server changes.** Pure client-side canvas render. No new endpoints, no new memory reads.

### Fixed — 🖼 **Per-filter counters + panel-open chip + filter sort/hide** *(v0.32 polish)*

- 🃏 **Per-filter live match counters** — each Item Filters card shows its own ground/equipped/inventory count instead of the same total smeared across every card. New summary strip on top of the tab shows the aggregate totals.
- 🟢 **Panel-open state chip** — the Item Filters tab now shows which panels are currently open (🟢 Character · 🟢 Inventory · ⚫ Stash), fed by `GET /api/panels` off the P1 panel resolvers. Real-time confirmation the resolvers work in production without needing another probe.
- 🔀 **Sort dropdown + hide-0-match toggle** on the Item Filters tab. Sort by name (default) / priority DESC / most matches now. Hide filters with zero current matches. Both persist to `localStorage`.

### Under the hood

- **Dashboard extracted from the C# raw-string embed to real asset files** — the ~3500-line inline HTML/CSS/JS in `DashboardHtml.cs` is now three embedded resources under `Web/Assets/dashboard/`: `dashboard.html` (80.6 KB), `dashboard.css` (29.3 KB), `dashboard.js` (140 KB). `DashboardHtml.cs` collapsed from 3541 LOC to a 40-LOC thin wrapper. Byte-for-byte identical output to pre-refactor (SHA256 pinned at every checkpoint during the 3-bead extraction). Unlocks JS lint, browser devtools debugging, editor syntax highlighting, and kills a whole class of encoding bugs that came from the C# raw-string embed. `AssemblePage` lazily loads the three assets on first `/` request and splices them via sentinel-comment replacement.
- New `Poe2Radar.Core.Session.DropTimeline` — thread-safe tracker mirroring the v0.30 `BossWipeLog` persistence pattern (load-on-construct + append-on-record + `Flush()`-on-dispose). Ring buffer via `LinkedList<T>` for O(1) eviction; in-memory `HashSet<uint>` for per-session dedup.
- New `/api/panels` endpoint providing character/inventory/stash open state (three `TryFind*Panel() != 0` checks per poll).
- Tick observation piggybacks the existing `_entities` walk right after `BuildItemLabels()` — no new memory reads, gates on `EnableDropTimeline`.
- 8 new xUnit facts covering `DropTimeline` (record, dedup, ring buffer cap, load, save, corrupt-file tolerance). Test suite: 739 → 747.
- `.gitattributes` gets `-text` rules on all three dashboard assets to preserve exact bytes across CI runners (prevents CRLF/LF normalization drift from breaking `Page` byte-parity).

### Deferred to v0.34+

- Highlight on **character equipment slots** — the panel resolver ships (v0.32); needs a one-shot slot fingerprint probe to pin the equipment-slot grid.
- Highlight on **stash grid tabs** — the stash panel resolver ships (v0.32); needs a stash-side inventory reader (`Poe2Live.ReadStashItems`) plus tab-switch detection.
- Specialty stash tabs (currency / fragment / essence / delirium / expedition) — each own drop.

---

## [0.32.0] — 2026-07-13 "Panorama"

### Added — 🖼 **Colored borders in-game on filter-matched inventory items**

- 🎯 **Your item filters now paint your bag.** Open the inventory panel and every cell whose item matches an enabled filter gets a border in that filter's color — the same colors your Item Filters dashboard cards show. Same match algorithm as ground drops: winner-takes-color when multiple filters hit (priority DESC, ties by list order), so your prioritized filters lead.
- 🧷 **Multi-cell items get one border spanning the whole slot rectangle.** A 2×2 body armour reads as one 2×2 highlight, not four tiny quadrants.
- ⚙️ **Gated behind two settings.** Flip both `EnableItemFilterLiveCounters` and `EnableInventoryHighlights` in `settings.json` (or the dashboard Settings → Advanced strip) to turn it on. Default off, same "opt-in for the memory read" posture as the God-Roll Detector.
- ⏱ **~1 Hz refresh cadence, ~1 s stale-close window.** Highlights refresh on the same 30-tick heartbeat the counters use — no per-frame memory cost. Closing the panel leaves the last painted cells up for at most a second before they clear. Documented tradeoff.

### Added — 📊 **Per-filter live match counters** *(each card shows its own count)*

- 🃏 **Each Item Filters card now displays its OWN ground / equipped / inventory count** instead of the same totals smeared across every card. An item that matches three filters bumps three counters — reading a card's number tells you "how many items would this filter highlight if it were the only one on."
- 📐 **New summary strip at the top of the tab** shows the aggregate totals across all enabled filters — one line, at-a-glance total: `🎯 total matches — ground: N · equipped: N · inventory: N`.
- 📦 **Equipped + inventory totals are live.** The v0.31 `/api/item-filters/matches` endpoint stubbed both at zero pending v0.32 — now they read from the same 1 Hz inventory snapshot that feeds the God-Roll Detector, so no new memory-read pressure when Gear Scorer is already on.
- 🕳 **Stash counter reserved but zero.** The payload envelope ships a `stash` field so the dashboard stays forward-compatible when a stash reader lands in v0.33+ — no reshape needed.

### Under the hood

- New panel-resolver framework at `Poe2Live.TryFindCharacterPanel` / `TryFindInventoryPanel` / `TryFindStashPanel`. Each uses an idx-hint fast path against the resolved UiRoot child, then falls back to a shape-fingerprint scan when the hint drifts (the same convention `Poe2Runeforge` uses for deep-panel walks). CharacterPanel vs StashPanel — which both anchor at the left edge — disambiguate on the presence of the stash-tab bottom bar's normalized-band fingerprint.
- New `Poe2Live.ComputeInventoryCellRect` pure math helper — takes a panel's unscaled screen origin + a cell's grid coordinates + grid dims + window size, returns a scaled screen-pixel rect. Directly unit-testable (no memory reads), used by the overlay renderer to place borders.
- New `Poe2Live.TryGetPanelUnscaledRect` + `Poe2Live.TryGetInventoryGridDims` — thin memory-read helpers over the already-validated UiElement + InventoryStruct offsets. Feed the resolver's panel handle into the math helper.
- New `Poe2Live.InventoryItem` slot fields: `SlotStartX/Y`, `SlotEndX/Y` (positional defaults appended — every existing 5-arg construction stays compiling).
- New `RenderContext.PanelHighlight` readonly record struct + `PanelHighlights` field — the render-thread contract for what to draw. Coords are unscaled UI base (2560×1600); the renderer scales at draw time so a mid-frame window resize can't skew the rects.
- New `RadarApp.BuildInventoryHighlights` internal static — pure aggregation from (inventory snapshot, filter engine, panel rect, grid dims) → highlight list. `RadarApp.CountPerFilterMatches` internal static — per-filter attribution for the dashboard card counts.
- New `Poe2Radar.Research --probe-panels` CLI walker for internal panel-fingerprint capture — interactively guides through Character/Inventory/Stash open/close cycles, diffs the UiRoot visibility bits, and prints normalized child fingerprints. Powers future v0.33+ probes for equipment slots + stash grids.
- 28 new xUnit tests: 10 panel resolver behavioral facts, 5 cell-rect math, 4 live-counter split, 3 per-filter attribution, 6 highlight builder. Test suite: 711 → 739.

### Deferred to v0.33+

- Highlight on **character equipment slots** — the panel resolver ships; needs a one-shot slot fingerprint probe to pin the equipment-slot grid inside the panel's content area.
- Highlight on **stash grid tabs** (regular / quad / jewel / map / relic) — the stash panel resolver ships; needs a stash-side inventory reader (`Poe2Live.ReadStashItems`) plus tab-switch detection before the highlight pipeline can attach.
- Specialty stash tabs (currency / fragment / essence / delirium / expedition) — each own drop.

---

## [0.31.1] — 2026-07-12 (Companion keypair rotation)

### Fixed — 🔐 **Rotated the Ed25519 supporter keypair before donations open**

- Rotated the Ed25519 keypair backing the Companion signed-supporter-code flow. The old public hex (`99392f...`) shipped with the v0.28 Companion drop was generated in-session while building the feature; before real Ko-fi donations start minting real codes, the keypair had to be rotated so the private half only ever existed in the Cloudflore Worker's encrypted secret store — never in git history.
- The new public key (`ac8da1...`) ships in `src/POE2Radar.Core/Support/supporter_public_key.txt`. The private half stays on the Worker only.
- Backwards-compat: donors who had already received v0.27-era hash-based codes still validate (the legacy path in `SupporterCodeValidator.IsSupporter` is untouched). Zero codes have been minted with the OLD private key, so this rotation invalidates nothing in the wild.
- 8 Ed25519 tests re-signed with the new keypair and all still pass; full suite 711/2/713 unchanged.

### Manual (LO — closes PMS-16 step 2)

- With this shipped, `wrangler secret put SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_HEX` on the deployed Cloudflare Worker will match the public key baked into POE2GPS v0.31.1+, so donor codes minted server-side will validate client-side on the first user launch after this release.

---

## [0.31.0] — 2026-07-12 "Prospector"

### Added — 🎯 **Item Filter engine** *(highlight items matching your desired affix combos)*

- 🎯 **New "Item Filters" dashboard tab** — card grid where each card is a filter with a name, border color, priority, enabled toggle, and a list of AND-linked requirements. Ships with 8 curated starter presets (ES Jeweler, Life Chest Baseline, Rare Amulet Baseline, Cast Speed Wand, Resist Ring, Faster Attacks Weapon, ES/Life Chest, Movement Speed Boots) disabled by default. Toggle any preset on, or click "+ New filter" to author your own.
- ✨ **Full stat-key DSL** — each requirement is a `statId + op (>=, <=, ==, between) + value` with optional scope (`prefix` / `suffix` / `implicit`) and optional `maxTier`. Match algorithm returns filters priority-sorted; the winning filter's color is drawn as the border in-game. Storage: `config/item_filters.json`. Full JSON round-trip via `/api/item-filters`.
- 💎 **Highlight on ground items** — dropped items whose affixes match an enabled filter now get a colored border on the ground label. Same shape as the existing unique-price highlight, per-filter color. When both apply, filter color wins over the legacy gold.
- 📊 **Live match counters** — each filter card shows how many items match on the ground right now. Equipped + inventory + stash counters land in v0.32.
- 🛡 **Restore starter presets** button — additively re-adds any preset id you've deleted (never removes your own filters).

### Fixed — 🗺 **/map view improvements**

- 🗺 **Fog reveal radius bumped 24 → 60 cells** (matches `AudioAlertRadiusCells` so both proximity systems agree). Community feedback: previous 24 was too tight in atlas + open zones. Also settings-configurable via `WebMapRevealRadiusCells` (Settings → Advanced) with range 20-200 — tune without a recompile.
- 🔍 **/map zoom with mousewheel + `+`/`-` keys.** Cursor-anchored zoom on the wheel (pixel under cursor stays put); center-anchored on keyboard. Range `0.5x`–`32x`. Persists across page reload via `localStorage`. HUD readout shows the current zoom level as `z<N.N>`.

### Under the hood

- New `ItemFilterEngine` in `POE2Radar.Core.Game` — load-on-construct + save-on-mutate + generation counter, mirrors the `DisplayRules` pattern. Storage `config/item_filters.json`. Match algorithm is thread-safe and allocation-friendly.
- New `default_item_filters.json` embedded resource — the shipped preset catalog. First-run copy materializes the seed to disk with `enabled: false`.
- New `/api/item-filters` GET/POST + `/api/item-filters/restore-presets` + `/api/item-filters/matches` endpoints.
- Extends `Poe2Live.ReadIdentityFromItem` to populate `EntityDot.ItemAffixes` on ground drops (respects the existing `_itemReadBudget` "read once per drop" contract). The affix data was already read for equipped items via the God-Roll Detector — this extension routes the same reader to ground drops.
- `ItemLabel.BorderColor` per-label field: `DrawItemLabels` honors it, replacing the hardcoded gold ColItemHi when set.
- 20 new xUnit tests (14 for the Match algorithm + 6 for storage/load/save round-trip + malformed tolerance + preset seed).

### Deferred to v0.32 "Panorama"

- Highlight on **character equipment slots** — data already flows (God-Roll Detector reads equipped items every 30 ticks); needs a one-shot live probe of the CharacterPanel UiRoot child index + slot fingerprints. Batched with v0.32's other panel walkers to share the probe session.
- Highlight on **player inventory panel** — server-side reads already ship; needs UI-panel walker + per-cell screen-rect projection.
- Highlight on **stash grid tabs** (regular / quad / jewel / map / relic) — InventoryStruct layout reuses; needs stash-panel walker + tab-switch detection.
- Specialty stash tabs (currency / fragment / essence / delirium / expedition) — each own bead in v0.33+.

---

## [0.30.0] — 2026-07-10 "Instinct"

### Added — 🪦 **Per-character boss wipe log** *(persistent · cross-session · discoverable)*

- 🪦 **Every death in a matched boss zone is logged** against your character name in a new persistent file at `config/boss_wipe_log.json` (schema: `{ characters: { charName: { bosses: { bossKey: count } } } }`). The next time you walk into that boss, the cheat-sheet panel title bar gets a **"🪦 Nx before"** tag so future-you sees what past-you learned.
- 📊 **New dashboard "Your wipe log" card** on the Bosses tab. Shows your current character, total wipes across all bosses, per-boss count sorted by "what's killing me most", plus a list of other characters on record. Feeds off a new `/api/wipe-log` endpoint that maps `bossKey → label` via the shipped `BossEncounterCatalog`.
- ⚙️ **Opt-out** with `TrackBossWipes = false` in `settings.json`. No data ever exfiltrates; the log file lives next to your other configs and can be nuked at any time.
- 🧠 **Only tracks boss zones** (matched cheat-sheet entries) — regular map deaths don't pollute the log. This makes the "what am I struggling with" surface actually useful long-term instead of a noise heap.

### Added — 💥 **Boss panel damage-type chip strip** *(finally, actually colored)*

- ☠ The boss cheat-sheet panel's damage-type row is no longer plain text — it's now a strip of **colored chips** matching the dashboard's boss card: `phys` cream · `fire` orange · `cold` blue · `ltng` yellow · `chaos` purple. Skips elements < 5% share. Reads at-a-glance in-fight instead of parsing a text list.

### Added — ⭐ **Waystone click-to-flag** *(personal red-flag list, remembered forever)*

- ◈ Click any mod row in the waystone panel to **toggle a ★ personal red-flag** on that mod name. Flagged mods get a ★ prefix regardless of the built-in Safe/Notable/Deadly verdict — "I have died to this mod combination before, don't miss it again." Persisted in `settings.WaystoneRedFlags` and immediately visible on the next parse.
- Never gates functional behavior — the parser still reports the same tiers to the dashboard. Cosmetic-only visual nudge, tailored to YOUR pain points instead of the shipped catalog's.

### Added — 🧪 **Panel state-machine tests** *(safety net for the panel logic)*

- 10 new xUnit tests in `WipeMemoryTests.cs` locking the wipe-counter contract: null/empty guards, increment semantics, snapshot independence, ctor tolerance, ClearZone/ClearAll behavior. Filed through the beads pipeline and executed by the `openrouter/qwen3-coder` worker — landed clean, `10/10 passed`, no regression.

### Under the hood

- New `WipeMemory` class — pure per-character counter, unit-tested, reused inside `BossWipeLog`.
- New `BossWipeLog` class — thread-safe, load-on-construct + save-on-mutate, tolerant of a missing / corrupt log file (starts empty, never crashes).
- `WorldSnapshot` gained a `PlayerName` field (from `_live.PlayerName(localPlayer)` which self-caches per localPlayer address) so the render thread has a stable identity key for the wipe log.
- New `/api/wipe-log` endpoint served by `ApiServer`, wired via a `wipeLogProvider` Func passed at ctor. Serializes `{ character, wipes, total, allCharacters }` as gzipped JSON like the sibling endpoints.

### Deferred to v0.31

- Dashboard "clear this boss" / "reset character" buttons for the wipe log (data model + endpoint already support it — just needs UI wire-in).
- Waystone red-flag: bulk-import a shipped "meta danger list" of community-flagged mods so first-time users get a sensible starting flag set.
- Damage-type icons via the atlas icon cache (chip strip is a strong interim; PNG glyphs could come later).

## [0.29.0] — 2026-07-10 "Panels"

### Added — 📋 **Panels** *(two new in-game overlay panels that pop when you need them and disappear when you don't · closable · collapsable · auto-dismissed on next zone entry)*

- ☠ **Boss cheat-sheet panel** *(top-left, auto-opens on boss zone entry)*
  - When the player enters a zone whose code matches a [`BossEncounterCatalog`](src/POE2Radar.Core/Game/BossEncounterCatalog.cs) entry (the same catalog that already ships in v0.25 Chorus + backs the Bosses dashboard tab), a translucent overlay panel pops up at top-left showing: **tier · category**, **damage-type mix** (phys / fire / cold / lightning / chaos shares, ≥ 5% only), **one-shots to dodge**, **phase cues** (HP threshold → note), **over-cap resist targets**, and **flask notes**. All from the catalog — no new data authoring; every existing pinnacle entry already reads.
  - **Closable (✕)** — dismiss the panel entirely until the next zone entry.
  - **Collapsable (▶/▼ caret)** — collapse to just the title bar to keep it in view but out of the way.
  - **Auto-dismissed** on next zone change — walk into a new zone and the panel is gone (or replaced, if the new zone is ALSO a boss arena).
- ◈ **Waystone risk panel** *(top-right, opens on `Ctrl+Alt+W` hotkey)*
  - Press `Ctrl+Alt+W` with a waystone copied to clipboard → the overlay parses it via [`WaystoneModRisk`](src/POE2Radar.Core/Game/WaystoneModRisk.cs) (the same parser the Waystone dashboard tab uses) and pops a panel showing: 🚨 **SKIP** banner when total risk ≥ 60, **rarity · tier · score**, **per-tier colored mod rows** (Deadly red, Notable orange, Safe green, LethalCombo dark red), and **triggered combos** with their bonus scores.
  - **Same close (✕) / collapse (▶/▼) / auto-dismiss** as the boss panel — dismiss OR walk into the next zone, whichever comes first.
  - Clipboard read is retry-safe (a Ko-fi tab / Discord / another app can briefly hold the clipboard without breaking the hotkey).

### Changed — 🌍 **Atlas display sites now speak your language**

- The `Language` setting shipped in v0.26 Reach now actually reaches the atlas display surfaces: 5 call sites in `RadarApp.cs` (dashboard `allMaps` filter list, dashboard `nodeList` per-node card, F10 atlas-tile inspector console output, and the **in-game atlas overlay label** — the highest-visibility one, drawn every frame on tracked atlas tiles) route through a new `LocalizedMapName(mapCode, fallback)` helper that reads `MapMeta.LocalizedName(_settings.Language)` and falls back to English if the key is missing or the setting is empty. Backwards-compatible: existing English users see identical strings.
- **Not** changed: the seed sites at `RadarApp.cs:3412-3413` (byCode dict) + `:3537-3538` (Citadel filter) + `:3636` (group color lookup) intentionally stay English — they're the match KEYS the rule system uses to identify tracked maps. Localizing them would break every existing user's atlas rules.

### Fixed — 💡 **Rules tab picker empty-state hint**

- When you open the Add-from-game-data picker in a zone that has none of the entities/tiles you're looking for (e.g. sitting in town when you want to add a Breach rule), the empty-state message now explains the workaround: *"Enter a Breach zone first, or close this and click Add blank rule — the match field now suggests Breach, Ritual, Expedition, Boss… as you type."* Closes gap B from the v0.28.1 audit.

### Under the hood

- New `Overlay/Native/ClipboardText.cs` — a tiny Win32 P/Invoke helper (OpenClipboard → GetClipboardData(CF_UNICODETEXT) → GlobalLock → PtrToStringUni) with a 4-attempt retry loop that survives another app briefly holding the clipboard. Read-only; the overlay never WRITES to the clipboard.
- New `Keybinds.WaystoneRisk` VK code (default `0x57` = W) added to `KeybindsSettings` alongside the existing rebindable keys. Persisted like all other keybinds.
- Two new panels share the existing overlay click-through / hit-rect infrastructure — no new input plumbing. Each panel's ✕ and caret each register their own `_legendRowRects` entry with distinct actions (`boss-close`, `boss-collapse`, `waystone-close`, `waystone-collapse`) that route through `OnOverlayClick`.
- Zone-change edge wired inside the existing `WorldTick` areaInstance-diff block — the same edge that clears the preload dedup sets and resets per-zone counters. One place, all reset.

### Deferred to v0.30

- Boss panel content-icons (currently text-only; would benefit from the Direct2D atlas-icon rendering path).
- Waystone panel: click a Deadly mod row to seed a Hidden-cull rule for that mod key.
- Panel position customization (currently boss = top-left, waystone = top-right; hardcoded).

---

## [0.28.1] — 2026-07-10 (rule suggestions)

### Fixed — 💡 **Rules tab match-field autocomplete + friendlier hint**

- 💡 The Rules tab match input now suggests common mechanic / entity names (**Breach**, **Ritual**, **Expedition**, **Essence**, **Strongbox**, **Shrine**, **Boss**, **Chest**, **NPC**, and more) as you type — pulled from the same curated `labels.json` vocabulary the Director + Entity Atlas tabs already use. Community-reported: a supporter wanted to add Breach to their rules and had no way to discover the term without reading the source. The label refactor in v0.24 renamed the seeded default rule to "Breach (Rift)" for clarity, but the underlying match term (`Breach`) is unchanged — this hotfix just makes that discoverable at the point of use.
- 💡 Placeholder updated: `match: metadata terms, comma-separated (blank = any) — try Breach, Expedition, Ritual, Boss…` so first-time visitors see valid examples inline.
- Nothing else changed. No new deps, no schema change, no migration, no backend touched — just three lines of dashboard HTML/JS.

---

## [0.28.0] — 2026-07-10 "Companion"

### Added — 🌐 **Companion** *(the eloquent supporter flow: Ed25519 signed codes end-to-end · Ko-fi → email → Discord role · no per-donor releases · no shipped hash list)*

- 🔐 **Ed25519 signed supporter codes.** New `SupporterSignedCode` verifier (in `Core/Support/`) uses BouncyCastle's Ed25519 primitives against a shipped `supporter_public_key.txt` embedded resource. Codes are formatted `poe2gps.<base64-payload>.<base64-signature>` — the payload carries the donor's email, tier, and issued timestamp; the signature is Ed25519 over the payload bytes. The private key never touches POE2GPS — it lives only on the Cloudflare Worker. Anyone extracting the exe gets the public key (useless for minting) instead of a hash list. Backwards-compatible: the v0.27.1 hash-based codes still validate through the same `IsSupporter` gate, so nobody's code stops working.
- 🌐 **Cloudflare Worker** at `cloudflare-worker/supporters-worker/` that receives Ko-fi webhooks, mints signed codes with the private key, emails the code to the donor (via Resend by default; drop in any provider), assigns the `☕ Supporter` Discord role via the bot API when the donor pastes their Discord handle in the Ko-fi donation message, and posts a `🎉 New supporter!` announcement to a Discord channel webhook (optional). Full deploy guide in `cloudflare-worker/supporters-worker/README.md`.
- 🤖 **Discord auto-role**. Ko-fi → Worker → Discord API. Donors add `discord: theirhandle` to the Ko-fi donation message and get the `☕ Supporter` role automatically (bot needs `Manage Roles` + role position above Supporter). Silent no-op when the handle is missing — donation still processes, code still emails.

### Changed

- `SupporterCodeValidator.IsSupporter` tries the Ed25519 signed-code path first, then falls back to the legacy hash-list check for v0.27-era codes. Full end-to-end backwards compatibility.
- Added `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` (~4 MB pure managed, no native deps) as the only new NuGet dep in `POE2Radar.Core` since the atlas port. Keeps the project's read-only compliance envelope intact.

### Manual (LO — see PMS-16)

- Regenerate the Ed25519 keypair before production use (the current shipped keypair was generated in-session with the sample code live in a test file — fine for dev, not for prod). Deploy the Worker with the new private hex secret; update the public hex in the app + regenerate the sample code test. Details in `cloudflare-worker/supporters-worker/README.md`.

### Deferred to v0.29

- Language wire-in for atlas display sites.
- Boss cheat-sheet overlay panel.
- Waystone Ctrl+Alt+W hotkey.
- Long List #39 Full-page browser views.
- Supporter-only preset packs.
- Roadmap voting card.

## [0.27.1] — 2026-07-10 (support automation)

### Added

- 🔧 **Maintainer helper for the supporter code flow.** The v0.27.0 supporter-code system required LO to compute SHA-256 hashes in a shell, edit C# source, and rebuild for every new Ko-fi donor. This drop moves the hash list out of C# into an embedded `supporter_hashes.json` and adds a dashboard admin section (visible via `?admin=1` on the dashboard URL) that does the whole flow in one place: type a raw code (or 🎲 generate a random one), the SHA-256 auto-computes live via WebCrypto with a Copy button, and paste-ready snippets for `supporter_hashes.json` + `supporters.json` + a Ko-fi DM template render as you type. LO's flow: type/generate, click 3 copy buttons, paste, commit, release, send the DM.
- ☕ **Real seed code shipped.** The v0.27.0 hash list was placeholder — nothing validated out-of-the-box. This drop ships a real working code (`POE2GPS-FIRST-COFFEE-2026`) so the cosmetic-unlock feature is discoverable immediately. Case + whitespace tolerant on paste.

### Changed

- **`SupporterCodeValidator.Hashes` migrated to `supporter_hashes.json`.** The C# `HashSet` is gone; the loader (`Lazy<HashSet<string>>`) reads the embedded JSON at first use. Adding a new code = edit ONE JSON file. Malformed / missing JSON fails closed (no code validates) rather than crashing.

---

## [0.27.0] — 2026-07-10 "Support" 🤝

### Added — 🤝 **Support** *(the community-first release · every supporter gets a place on the roll · cosmetic perks for Ko-fi backers · today's ES-offset patch baked in)*

- 🩹 **ES-offset patch baked in.** GGG shifted the EnergyShield offset again today (0x264 → 0x24C). The auto-heal fixed it correctly for everyone the moment they launched, but nobody should have to pay that startup cost on every launch. Baked the new offset into the shipped default so v0.27+ launches clean; the auto-heal stays as the belt-and-suspenders backstop for any *future* drift.
- 🤝 **Supporters card v2 — total count + latest supporter + rotating pitch.** The Supporters card at the top of Settings now shows the live community-backer total, the latest supporter's name in gold, and rotates through five community pitch quotes so the message stays fresh across visits. Pill roll below still shows every backer with a tier color and a hover-title for their role.
- 📄 **SUPPORTERS.md hall of fame.** New top-level [`SUPPORTERS.md`](SUPPORTERS.md) is a browsable markdown table sorted by tier (🥇 Gold / 🥈 Silver / 🥉 Bronze / 💛 Community) — auto-generated from `supporters.json` so every release ships a fresh copy. Also linked from the README so it's discoverable without opening the app.
- ☕ **Ko-fi supporter code + cosmetic dashboard palettes.** Ko-fi backers now get a code (LO ships codes via Ko-fi email / Discord DM after donations). Paste the code into ⚙️ Settings → **Supporter code**, and two cosmetic palettes unlock: **Kalguuran Gold** (warm gold on deep amber, callback to the Kalguuran act aesthetic) and **Wraeclast Terminal** (green-phosphor CRT). Also unlocks an optional **☕ Supporter chip** on the Session HUD — off by default; toggle in Settings. All cosmetic — the tool's functional surface stays identical for everyone forever. `SupporterCodeValidator` in `Core/Support/` uses SHA-256 on shipped hashes; local-only, never phones home, honor-system gate.
- 📝 **README Ko-fi pitch rewritten.** The Ko-fi section now leads with the free-forever promise, then makes the actual pitch (what a coffee funds), then lists the three community perks: Supporters-roll placement, cosmetic unlock code, and Discord `☕ Supporter` role. Sets the tone that this is a community-first drop, not a paywall migration.

### Deferred to v0.28 "Companion"

Everything from v0.26's deferred list plus this drop's scope-cuts:

- **Language wire-in** for atlas display sites (the setting reads but no site consumes it yet).
- **Boss cheat-sheet overlay panel** (dashboard tab is the browsable surface; overlay panel is reactive-on-arena-entry).
- **Waystone Ctrl+Alt+W hotkey** (grab clipboard + open the tab).
- **Long List #39** Full-page browser views (Rules / Landmarks / Nameplates).
- **Supporter-only preset packs** (3-4 curated `.poe2preset` files).
- **Roadmap voting card** (supporters get 3 votes / non-supporters 1).
- **Ko-fi webhook automation** (email code delivery).

---

## [0.26.0] — 2026-07-10 "Reach"

### Added — 🌏 **Reach** *(boss cheat sheets · waystone mod-risk warnings · localized atlas names · dashboard groupings · a supporters roll · issue templates get a lane for post-patch drift)*

- 📚 **Boss encounter cheat sheets.** New `Bosses` tab in the dashboard reads a shipped `BossEncounterCatalog` (5 pinnacle entries seeded — Arbiter of Ash, Xesht, Kosis, The Maven, The Bodach — hand-authored, paraphrased from public wiki summaries). Each card shows the boss's damage-type mix (color-coded pills), the top one-shots to dodge, over-cap thresholds by element, flask notes, and phase cues. `BossEncounterCatalog.ByBossKey` / `ByZoneCode(MapUberBoss_*)` / `ByMetadata(...)` surfaces are already wired for an overlay panel in a follow-up drop.
- ⚠️ **Waystone mod-risk parser.** New `Waystone` tab: paste a Ctrl+C'd waystone item text and get a tiered mod list (Safe / Notable / Deadly), triggered danger combos (reflect+crit, no-leech+no-regen, etc), a total risk score, and a red **SKIP RECOMMENDED** banner when the score ≥ 60. Rules and combo table live in embedded JSON (`poe2_waystone_mod_risk.json`) so future mod additions don't need a code release. Server-side `/api/waystone/parse` is loopback-gated; the tab renders results in-place.
- 🌐 **Localized atlas map names.** `AtlasMapData.MapMeta` now exposes `Translates` (10 languages: english, french, german, japanese, korean, portuguese, russian, spanish, thai, traditional chinese) and a `LocalizedName(language)` helper. `RadarSettings.Language` defaults to Windows system locale on first launch (via `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName` mapped to the shipped keys); English fallback for everything else. Wiring the language into the display paths (Poe2Atlas emission + dashboard picker) is scheduled for a follow-up so the setting has an effect out of the box.
- 🗂️ **Settings tab section-header dividers.** The 22-card Settings tab now shows section dividers between the natural card groups: `HUD panels`, `Overlay rendering`, `Advanced`, `Integrations`. Full-width grid rows with a Cinzel-styled label — cards flow into the next section on the same panel-grid. Zero JS refactor: `wireSettings()` uses document-wide `[data-set]` selectors that survive the DOM reshape.
- ☕ **Supporters card on the dashboard.** New `Supporters` card at the top of Settings shows a name-pill roll seeded with the existing contributors (LO, torx, Kaonashi, Diamondsr, Sidefx, Verahsa). Tier keys (`gold` / `silver` / `bronze` / `community`) drive the pill color; each pill's `title` attribute shows the contributor's role on hover. Card also carries the Ko-fi call-out. Backers get added by editing the embedded `supporters.json` and shipping a release — no CI schema, no server-side auth.
- 🙏 **Two more names in the Special thanks section of the README** — `Sidefx` and `Verahsa` for continued community feedback and testing help.

### Deferred to v0.27 "Companion"
- Localization: wire the `RadarSettings.Language` into the atlas display path (currently the setting reads but no display site consumes it yet).
- Overlay boss cheat-sheet panel that surfaces the current-zone entry on arena entry (dashboard tab is the browsable surface).
- Waystone card global hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+W) that grabs clipboard + opens the tab.
- Long List #39 Full-page browser views (Rules / Landmarks / Nameplates).

---

## [0.25.1] — 2026-07-10 (hotfix)

### Fixed

- 🚨 **`OverlayRenderer.DrawMap` crash on entity/landmark list race.** After a game patch shifted the ES offset (0x264→0x24C, auto-heal fired successfully) some users hit a fatal `System.InvalidOperationException: Collection was modified` inside `OverlayRenderer.DrawMap`'s entity/landmark loops. Defensive fix wraps both `foreach (var e in ctx.Entities)` and `foreach (var lm in ctx.Landmarks)` in index-based iteration + try/catch — if the world thread re-slices the list mid-render the current frame's remaining dots/landmarks are dropped and the overlay recovers on the next present. No feature change, no data loss — just no more crash.

---

## [0.25.0] — 2026-07-10 "Chorus"

### Added — 🎼 **Chorus** *(three new Zone Summary chips light up the corner HUD)*

- 📊 **Zone Summary: kills-this-zone chip.** Always visible next to the `Monsters` row. Increments alongside session kills but resets to zero on every zone entry, so you can tell at a glance how much of the current map you've actually cleared. `KillTracker` grew a parallel per-zone counter that clears in `ClearZone()` and increments in lockstep with the session counter — session totals stay untouched by zone resets. Locked by three new `KillTrackerTests` cases.
- 🌀 **Zone Summary: nearest-mechanic chip.** When any league mechanic (Runestone / Ritual Altar / Breach / Strongbox / Essence Monolith / Shrine) is loaded in the current zone, the panel shows a `Nearest  <kind>  <distance>` row. Distance is grid-units from the player, computed in the same entity walk that produces the mechanic counts. Tier-ranked so a Ritual/Breach beats an Expedition at the same distance.
- ⭐ **Zone Summary: boss-arena flag.** `★ Boss Arena` lights up when the current zone contains any Unique-rarity entity whose metadata carries `BossArena`. Runs off the same entity walk — zero new memory reads, zero new tick cost.

### Deferred to v0.26 "Reach"
- Settings tab five-group section headers (Short List #7) — the DOM restructure needs its own reviewed drop.
- Waystone/map mod-risk warning card (Long List #41).
- Boss encounter cheat sheet (Long List #42).
- Localization pipeline (Long List #38) + full-page browser views (Long List #39).

## [0.24.0] — 2026-07-10 "Groove"

### Added — 🎧 **Groove** *(dashboard shortcuts land · Discord Rich Presence gets 5 new tokens · confusing radar labels rewritten · issue templates get a patch-drift lane and the healer log gets its due)*

- ⌨️ **Dashboard keyboard shortcuts + help modal.** Press <kbd>/</kbd> to focus the search box on the current tab, <kbd>1</kbd>–<kbd>7</kbd> to jump between tabs (Rules / Landmarks / Atlas / Settings / Director / Entity Atlas / Gear), <kbd>?</kbd> to toggle a shortcut cheat sheet, <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close any open modal and cancel keybind capture. Shortcuts sit out while you're typing in a text input. Also lays the plumbing for a central save-toast (`flashSaved()`) that new callsites can adopt without touching the 10 per-card `savedMsg*` spans in flight today.
- 🎮 **Discord Rich Presence: 5 new tokens.** Templates can now use `{hp}`, `{mana}`, `{es}`, `{deaths}`, and `{boss}` in addition to the existing `{area}`, `{level}`, `{zones}`, `{mapshr}`, `{kills}`, `{xpeff}`. `{boss}` lights up as "in boss arena" when the current zone contains any Unique-rarity entity — cheap O(entities) scan on the 15 s presence cadence, no new memory reads. Dashboard preview mirrors the same token set.
- 🏷️ **Radar label pass.** "Expedition" now renders as "Runestone (League Event)" — one user report we sat on for too long. Also: "Ritual" → "Ritual Altar (League Event)", "Breach" → "Breach (Rift)", "Essence" → "Essence Monolith", "Abyss Crack" → "Abyss Pit (League Event)", "Quest Object" → "Quest Item", `EinharQuestMarker` → "Einhar (Bestiary NPC)". All 3 shipped presets (boss_hunter, high_contrast, minimal) get the same rewrites. No behavior change — the metadata match patterns stay identical, only the display label softens.
- 🐛 **Patch-drift issue template + CONTRIBUTING.md expansion.** New `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/patch-drift.yml` collects the fields the maintainer actually needs after a game patch shifts memory offsets: your POE2GPS version, the PoE2 patch, the subsystem that broke, the healer-log lines (POE2GPS auto-heals vitals offsets on startup and prints `auto-relocated 0x{old}→0x{new}` — that line goes in the report). CONTRIBUTING.md now covers the four data streams (atlas / buffs / preload / **trace**), points at the roadmap for feature requests, and links Discord + Discussions from the top. Feature-request template asks users to check the roadmap first.
- 🔗 **Stale Discord URL fixed.** `config.yml` was pointing at `discord.gg/poe2gps` (never existed); now points at the canonical `discord.gg/32qdzWRja3` matching README.

### Deferred to v0.25 "Chorus"
- Settings tab five-group section headers (roadmap Short List #7) — the DOM restructure earned its own reviewed drop.

---

## [0.23.0] — 2026-07-10 "Signal"

### Added — 📡 **Signal** *(data flowing where it should — probe traces reaching the community pool · alerts audibly signaling · terrain visible for the first time · preload panel actually manageable)*

- 📈 **Campaign Probe (opt-out, on by default).** Since v0.22 POE2GPS has quietly gathered anonymized zone-traversal, level-up, boss-encounter, checkpoint-touch, waypoint-unlock, area-transition, and passive-allocation events into a local JSONL file at `%APPDATA%\poe2gps\campaign_traces\`. That data now has a home: every Contribute click (atlas / buffs / preload) auto-piggybacks a trace upload to the community pool, so users who already contribute never need to think about it. Toggle in ⚙️ Settings → **Enable Campaign Probe** — flip off to disable both collection AND upload, no restart needed. Install-ID resets on request from the dashboard so you can start clean any time. UI-tree observers (dialogue, quest-reward) remain silent pending an in-game verification pass; every event that fires today is verified live.
- 🗺️ **`/map` renders terrain again — for real this time.** The walkable-terrain layer has been silently missing since v0.20.0. Path polylines rendered on a dark background, so the symptom read as "map ok, colors dark" rather than "no terrain layer." Root cause was a wire-format mismatch between `/api/map` (JSON number `areaHash`) and `/stream` SSE (hex-string `area`) — the client compared them with strict `!==` and always rejected the terrain payload. One-line client-side coercion fixes it, plus a regression test that locks the both-sides contract so a future refactor can't silently drift back.
- 🔊 **Alert volume slider works now.** Dragging the volume slider posted its value as a JSON string; the server-side `TryInt` gate rejected strings; the setting was silently dropped and audio cues kept the boot-time default. One-line fix in `wireSettings()` coerces `type="range"` values to Number before POST.
- 🗂️ **Preload panel: collapse toggle + hide-on-spawn.** Click the caret next to `PRELOAD` in the panel title to fold everything but the title; click again to reopen. Preload rows for bosses and unique monsters now hide from the panel automatically once the entity appears in the live entity list — the panel stays clean as encounters resolve. Shrines / Chests / Rituals are tile-scoped and stay visible until zone change (no spawn-detection binding for those categories).
- 📤 **Trace uploads piggyback on every Contribute click.** The `#tpContribute` button in the Zone Plan card stays for manual sends but now shows an `auto-fires with atlas contributions` subtitle. Piggyback POSTs are fire-and-forget — a trace failure at the Worker (or a `enableCampaignProbe=false` toggle) never blocks the primary Contribute checkmark.

### Fixed

- **`/map` black-background regression** (see the `/map` bullet above — technically a v0.20.0 latent bug that no one noticed because the polylines still rendered).
- **Alert volume slider no-op** (see above — v0.22.x-and-prior behaviour was a silent write-drop).

---

## [0.22.0] — 2026-07-09 "Threshold"

### Added — 🚪 **Threshold** *(waygates render as waygates · XP/hour lands on the Session HUD · monolith panel collapses when you're done reading it · atlas content icons snap back to true)*

- 📈 **XP/hour on the Session HUD.** *(opt-in, off by default)* A new **XP/hr** row lives inside the existing Session HUD panel — no new panel, no new hotkey. Enable in ⚙️ Settings → Session HUD → **Show XP rate**. Rolling window is user-tunable from **1 to 60 minutes** (default 5), mirrored on `/api/settings` as `sessionHudShowXpRate` + `sessionHudXpWindowMinutes`. The ring survives zone crossings (it's a grind metric, not a zone metric); town frames don't append so hideout time doesn't drag the rate — reuses the existing **Exclude Towns From Pace** toggle. **Ctrl+Alt+R** resets it alongside the rest of the HUD. While the window is still filling (roughly the first 5 minutes) the row prints a **session-average fallback rate** so you see a live number immediately; once the ring is full it switches to the true windowed rate. When there are enough samples, the row also prints a `(Nm to L##)` **time-to-next-level** estimate off the built-in level curve. **Zero-cost when off:** with the row disabled, the fallback character-XP read is skipped entirely — a spy test locks the guarantee for 1000 disabled ticks. Closes **PMS-6** (Long List #34, XP/hour Session HUD chip).
- 🚪 **Waygates render as tracked landmarks.** Built-in Tile display rule ships for the end-game `WaygateDevice` entity — Navigable, Eye-shape marker, distinct cyan — so waygates surface on the radar the moment they enter range. Idempotent one-shot migration (`built_in_tile_rules_v1`) folded into the `AppliedMigrations` list; upgrading from v0.21 seeds the rule once, additive-only, no state loss. An explicit **exactly-one-marker** test guards the row against a future atlas-landmark port silently double-stamping the same entity.
- 🩹 **Atlas content-icon draw fix.** Content-icons stamped on fogged atlas nodes (Breach / Boss / Essence / Expedition / …) were mis-rendering their destination rect at high zoom levels — one axis of the square was pulling the wrong dimension. Pattern-matched port straightens the rect so icons stay pixel-aligned to their node at every zoom, and the math is extracted behind a pure helper so a regression trips at unit-test time.
- 🗂️ **Click-to-collapse nearby-monolith reward panel.** New caret on the panel's title row toggles a persisted collapsed state — the reward rows hide, the title stays. `MonolithsTop` pre-sort/cap-to-6 semantics preserved: POE2GPS's monolith prioritization is untouched by the collapse toggle.

### Fixed

- Nothing user-visible beyond the atlas content-icon rect above.

### Compliance

- 🛡️ **100% read-only.** Zero new memory writes. Zero new offset writes. Zero new input paths. Every new setting respects zero-cost-when-off. v0.20 wire format additive-only — no SSE key removals, no rename.

## [Unreleased] — v0.21 "Guided Campaign"

### Special thanks
Enormous thanks to **syrairc** for green-lighting [ExileCampaigns2](https://github.com/syrairc/ExileCampaigns2)'s integration into POE2GPS. v0.21's campaign step guide is a direct port of upstream route data + advance logic. Upstream: <https://github.com/syrairc/ExileCampaigns2> · license: `TODO(syrairc-license)` · commit: `TODO(syrairc-hash)`.

### PMS-13 deploy runbook (maintainer)

The v0.21 Cloudflare Worker rewrite splits `/submit` into three sibling routes
(`/submit-atlas`, `/submit-buffs`, `/submit-preload`) with a shared NFKD+leet profanity
filter and a KV-backed 5/60s rate limit. The KV binding requires a namespace ID that only
the maintainer's Cloudflare account can mint, so deploy is a manual step:

```
cd cloudflare-worker
wrangler kv:namespace create RATE_KV        # capture the returned id
# paste the id into wrangler.toml, replacing the placeholder sentinel
wrangler deploy
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN            # if not already set
bash ../resources/poe2-data/smoke-worker.sh https://poe2gps-contribute.<you>.workers.dev
```

Only after `SMOKE PASS` prints may the `CF-DASH-BUTTONS` PR open — ordering gate from
the v0.21 spec §12 (stale desktop clients hitting new routes before deploy see a clean 404
rather than a schema-mismatch 400).

### Changed — 🧭 **Guided Campaign** *(ExileCampaigns2 route + advance engine on-board · community pipeline hardened for real contributors)*

- 🧭 **Campaign step guide from syrairc's ExileCampaigns2.** The full ExileCampaigns2 route data (602 KB) + advance-engine logic ported to POE2GPS under `Campaign/Guide/`. Ships as a **Parallel Rail** — the new step guide runs alongside (not replacing) the existing Campaign GPS + Objective Director, hooked at `RadarApp.CampaignReconcile`. Enable via ⚙️ Settings → Campaign GPS; the panel renders on the **Director tab** of the Dashboard.
- 📡 **CampaignGuide additive SSE key.** New immutable `CampaignStepInstruction` record struct published alongside `CampaignGps` on `/stream`. v0.20.x clients keep working — additive-only wire format is non-negotiable, locked by golden-DTO snapshot tests.
- 🎯 **Graceful area-boundary forward-snap.** Six advance signals are stubbed until v0.22's quest-flag reader (`QuestFlagSatisfied`, `WaypointPulsed`, `SatisfiedFlagCount`, `TalkProgress`, `InteractProgress`, quest-item `LootSatisfied`). Four live signals ship today: area, proximity, kill, player-inventory loot. Steps whose only advance signal is stubbed stall until you cross into the next zone — the cursor forward-snaps past them at the area boundary. Persistent Campaign-panel badge preempts bug reports.
- 🖥️ **Campaign panel on Dashboard.** New step text row + graceful-degradation badge + persistent syrairc attribution with clickable link to ExileCampaigns2. Zero-cost-when-off: the panel elements ship with `hidden` in the static markup and stay that way until `CampaignGuide` populates.

**Community pipeline hardening:**

- 🚀 **Three sibling Worker routes** — `POST /submit-atlas` (existing shape, v0.20.x backward-compat), `POST /submit-buffs` (buff metadata + tier), `POST /submit-preload` (metadata paths only, rejects bare `.dds`/`.ao`). Shared middleware: NFKD-normalized leet-fold profanity filter (kills the leet-substitution bypasses of the slur list), simple KV counter rate limit (5 requests / 60s per `CF-Connecting-IP`), gh dispatch. Stale desktop clients hitting the old `/submit` route see a clean 404 instead of a schema-mismatch 400.
- ➕ **Buff + preload Contribute buttons** on their respective ⚙️ Settings cards — the buttons appear once you enable the **Buff icons** and **Preload Alert** cards. New `/api/contribute-buffs` + `/api/contribute-preload` handlers pack observed data from the existing `/api/buffs` and `/api/preload` sources and forward to the Worker. `merge_community.py` gains buffs + preload fold branches targeting `poe2_notable_buffs_community.json` and a preload-community sidecar.
- 🔕 **Silent-fallback fix (SL #15).** Missing Contribute URL used to silently open a generic GitHub issue form — contributors thought they submitted but hadn't. Split into two distinct sentinels (`settingsFetchFailed` vs `contributeUrlEmpty`) with actionable toasts. Empty URL surfaces a "Restore default URL" action; settings-fetch failure surfaces retry copy. Applied across all three Contribute buttons.
- 📝 **Contribution surface: bug-report + feature-request + config issue templates + root `CONTRIBUTING.md`** with quick-links to atlas/buff/preload paths. `entity-name-submission.yml` label reconciled from `atlas-submission` to `community-pack`. `resources/poe2-data/relabel-atlas-issues.sh` (idempotent + `--dry-run`) migrates existing open issues so nothing gets orphaned. New CI workflow rejects internal-tooling paths from leaking into any public surface.
- 🎉 **Credit block emission in `merge_community.py`.** Now fetches `body,author,number,url` per issue and emits a paste-ready markdown credit block at end-of-run, with `@unknown` fallback for deleted-account submissions, deterministic sort, and an idempotency test. Correction: `cloudflare-worker/README.md` no longer claims auto-close behavior it never had.
- 📕 **`merge_atlas_packs.py` deprecated (SL #16 Path B).** `merge_community.py` becomes the single merge rail. Deprecation banner on invocation + `docs/CONTRIBUTING-atlas.md` redirect stub. Legacy script preserved for reference / re-fold of old issues.

### Fixed

- 🗺️ **`/map` terrain-race fix.** A Discord tester reported polylines + entities visible but a fully black map. Root cause: race between the first SSE sample carrying the area code and the world-thread's terrain callback becoming ready — `/api/map` returned `{"ready":false}` which prior `map.js` treated as a permanent mismatch (`data.areaHash` undefined, `!== area`, `return null`). `fetchTerrain` now polls `/api/map` at 250 ms intervals for up to 5 s while the server reports `ready:false`, then builds the canvases when the payload arrives. Zone-out during poll cancels via a token check so we don't burn network on a stale area. Latent since v0.20.0 shipped the terrain callback path; v0.21's per-tick world work likely shifted the timing enough to lose the race consistently. Wire contract locked by 4 new C# tests.
- ⏱️ **CI 30Hz cadence test is env-aware.** GitHub Actions Windows runners sometimes hit 18 Hz under shared-VM load — env-aware bounds (15-99 on CI, 81-99 locally) keep the tight local regression signal while accepting VM jitter on CI. Test infra only; no runtime change.

## [0.20.1] — 2026-07-07
### Changed — 🧹 **Roadclearing** *(v0.20.0 review shelf drained + browser-view substrate deepened)*
- 🩺 **SseChannel heartbeat race closed for good.** The v0.20.0 T3 plan-mandated race between last-subscriber teardown and new-subscriber add is now impossible — both paths lock `_latestLock`. Publish contention is negligible; add/remove are rare. Loops that leaked one 15s ping under contention now don't.
- 🗺️ **Delta entities on `/stream`.** After the first full snapshot per subscriber, subsequent SSE messages emit `{add, upd, del}` in `entitiesDelta`. Payload shrinks meaningfully in heavy Breach / Ritual moments; sets up multi-viewer party overlays. Backward-compatible: v0.20.0 clients keep working; new `map.js` merges deltas into a persistent `Map<id, entity>`.
- 🛤️ **Path polylines land on `/map`.** The atlas/nav routing already computed by the native overlay now surfaces on the browser minimap as pathBlue polylines. New `/api/paths` route + `paths` SSE field. Layer 5 in the z-order (between fog and landmarks).
- 🌐 **Configurable update URL + in-app RC channel.** New ⚙️ Settings → Auto-Update controls: **UpdateChannel** (`stable` = `/releases/latest`, `preview` = newest GitHub prerelease) and **UpdateUrl** (custom mirror override, e.g. Gitee). SHA-256 verification + one-generation rollback + crash-loop threshold all unchanged. Mainland/VPN users unblocked; tester lane opened.
- 🧠 **Migration-guard consolidation.** 11 one-shot bool fields in `RadarSettings` (`AtlasArrowsSeeded`, `SeedLandmarksOnce`, …) collapse into a single `AppliedMigrations: List<string>`. Your existing `config/radar_settings.json` migrates transparently on first load — no state loss, no seeds re-firing. Stops the settings model growing linearly with every future one-shot seed.
- 🎨 **Dashboard hygiene.** `.card-title` CSS finally defined — the Session panel stops rendering unstyled. Palette drift on three inline colours (`#f66`, `#4a525c`, `#1a1a1a`) fixed via CSS custom properties. Settings search no longer leaks matches from collapsed cards.
- 🐭 **Cosmetic + correctness sweep.** GPS toggle keydown handler skips `<input>` / `<textarea>` / `e.repeat`. Duplicate GPS-mode init line removed. `map.js` clearRect + veil use consistent CSS-pixel dims on HiDPI. `findBracket` comment matches code. Dead port-counter statics dropped. `onZoneChange` guards concurrent invocations. `Self == el` liveness guard drops recycled-slot phantom markers (audit-2026-06-22 §4). `Poe2Atlas.ReadRegion` 1 MiB buffer hoisted to a reused field (audit-2026-06-27). `/stream` assertion added to the only-obs route-gate test.
- 🩺 **Vitals offsets re-validated for the current PoE2 patch.** The only real TODO in `src/` closed; README badge held / bumped as the Research probe reports.
- 🎯 **Blank `/map` regression closed.** A narrow race where `window.innerWidth` was `0` at page load could leave the canvas backing store 0×0 — HUD paints fine, everything else stays black. `resizeCanvas` now retries on the next `rAF` until dims are non-zero, `lerpPose` recovers from NaN endpoints, and `frame()` skips draws when the canvas or `pose.player.x/y` isn't ready. Reported by a Discord tester ❤️.
- 🛡️ **100% read-only.** Zero new memory reads. Every feature respects the zero-cost-when-off contract.

## [0.20.0] — 2026-07-06
### Added — 🖥️ **Web Views v2: Native-Feel** *(monitor-refresh `/map` + `/obs`, opt-in, default off)*
- 🖥️ **`/map` and `/obs` now render at your monitor's refresh rate with 1:1 in-game visual language.** Point any browser (second monitor, tablet, capture PC) at `http://<your-ip>:7777/map` or `/obs` and you get the same rings, chevrons, terrain mask, off-screen arrows, POIs and landmarks the overlay draws — at the same cadence, laid out the same way. **Opt-in** in ⚙️ Settings → Streaming; **default is off** so nothing new touches the network unless you flip it on.
- 📡 **New `/stream` SSE endpoint pushes snapshots at 30 Hz.** Server-Sent Events replaces polling for the map surface — the browser stops asking "any change?" ten times a second and just listens. Lower CPU on the overlay side, lower jitter on the browser side, and the render loop can finally keep up with the game.
- ⚡ **Multithreaded `HttpListener` + gzip on the big payloads.** Request handling is no longer single-file; `/api/map`, `/api/atlas`, and `/landmarks` now negotiate gzip so slower Wi-Fi links (phones, tablets on 2.4 GHz) get the same responsiveness as your desk.
- 🎯 **`/stream` entity cap raised 600 → 800 per snapshot.** In heavy Breach / Ritual / Delirium moments the browser view no longer clips extra mobs off the edge of the snapshot before you can see them.
- 🩸 **Monolith reward icons now surface to the browser views.** The reward panel you already have on the in-game overlay is mirrored to `/map` / `/obs`, so a co-pilot watching your second screen sees the same choice you do.
- 🛡️ **100% read-only.** Every one of the above ships zero new memory reads and zero new input paths. The 60 Hz web renderer is pure math over data POE2GPS already reads for the in-game overlay — same data, more screens.

### Changed
- 🧰 **Legacy `MapPageHtml.cs` / `ObsOverlayHtml.cs` retired.** Browser assets now ship as embedded resources — smaller diff surface, cleaner rebuilds, no behavior change for viewers.
- 📚 **Tencent CN client compatibility — recon design doc published.** Not a shipped feature yet; the design notes (`2026-07-06-v0.20.0-map-60hz-clone-design.md`) document what the CN client looks like structurally so a future release can support it cleanly.

## [0.19.6] — 2026-07-02
### Fixed — 🧭 **Off-screen Atlas arrows are back — and now they point true**
- 🧭 **Off-screen Atlas arrows restored, accurate.** v0.19.5 turned them off because PoE2 stops updating a node's on-screen position the moment it scrolls off-screen, so the old arrows aimed at stale/garbage coordinates ("ghost arrows to nothing"). POE2GPS now derives each off-screen arrow's direction from the target node's **stable grid coordinate** instead: it fits the grid→screen mapping from all the nodes currently **on**-screen (whose positions are valid) and uses that to place any off-screen target reliably. So your tracked Citadels/maps get a border arrow that actually points at them, and it stays correct as you pan.
- 🎯 Arrows follow the **same per-tag rules** as before (⚙️ Settings → Atlas) — no new toggle. On-screen node **rings, routes, and chevrons are unchanged**. If the view is too sparse to fit the mapping, off-screen arrows simply don't draw that frame (never a ghost). Still **100% read-only** — pure render-side math over data already read.

## [0.19.5] — 2026-07-02
### Changed
- 🧭 **Off-screen Atlas arrows turned off** (the "ghost arrows pointing at nothing"). PoE2 stops updating a map node's position the moment it scrolls off-screen, so any arrow toward an off-screen target was aiming at stale/garbage coordinates — there's no reliable way to point at it from the off-screen position. On-screen node **rings are unchanged**. Bringing off-screen arrows back *accurately* (using each node's stable grid coordinate instead of the unreliable position) is a planned follow-up.

## [0.19.4] — 2026-07-02
### Fixed
- 🧭 **No more "ghost" Atlas arrows pointing at nothing.** PoE2 stops updating an Atlas node's position the moment it scrolls off-screen, so arrows toward far-off tracked maps/Citadels were aiming at stale/garbage positions — arrows to empty space. The overlay now suppresses an arrow whose target projects to an implausible distance (the tell-tale of a culled node's junk position), so you only see arrows that actually point at something. On-screen node rings are unchanged. (Accurate arrows to *never-seen* distant nodes need a grid-based follow-up — those were the ghosts, and never pointed correctly.)

## [0.19.3] — 2026-07-02
### Fixed
- 🖥️ **No more freeze/crash when you click or select text in the console.** Windows "Quick Edit" mode pauses a console app's output the instant you select text — which froze POE2GPS (it stops reading the game) and looked like a crash, especially when trying to copy a diagnostic line. Quick Edit is now disabled, so interacting with the console window never freezes the overlay.
- 🩸 **Energy Shield read corrected for the current patch** — the ES vital offset drifted (`0x248 → 0x264`) and is now updated. (POE2GPS already self-heals per-user offset drift, so ES kept working — this just makes the built-in value correct and silences the drift notice.)
### Added
- 📝 **`config/poe2gps.log`** — everything printed to the console is now also written to a log file next to the exe, so diagnostics are easy to copy and report, and any unhandled error writes a full stack trace there. Bug reports just got a lot more actionable.
- 🙏 Thanks to **Diamondsr** for the reports + diagnostics that drove these fixes (added to Credits).

## [0.19.2] — 2026-07-02
### Fixed — 🧭 **Atlas markers piling up at the top**
- 🧭 **Fixed Atlas node markers / route arrows piling up at the top of the screen** instead of sitting on their nodes. This was a regression from the v0.18.0 Stealth-Reads pass: the Atlas overlay could **freeze its layout on an indeterminate view** (most often right after the new auto-updater relaunched the app, before the window size was known) and hold stale positions. It now never freezes on an unresolved view and always uses live node positions.
- 🔬 **Reads were never the problem.** An in-game diagnostic confirmed the memory reads, offsets, and panel detection were all correct on 0.5.4 — this was purely overlay render logic. Still **100% read-only**. Huge thanks to the community members who reported it and ran the diagnostic. ❤️

## [0.19.1] — 2026-07-02
### Added — 🔄 **Silent Auto-Update** & 🧭 **True-North Map**
- 🔄 **POE2GPS updates itself.** When a newer release exists on our GitHub, POE2GPS downloads it in the background, verifies it (**SHA-256**), and installs it on your next launch — no more hunting for a zip. Fully **opt-out-able**: **⚙️ Settings → Auto-Update → Silent / Notify only / Off**.
- 🛡️ **Safe by design.** Downloads only from `github.com/luther-rotmg/POE2GPS` over HTTPS, verifies the checksum before installing, swaps only `Overlay.exe`, and **never touches your `config/` or `icons/`**. Keeps `Overlay.old.exe` for one generation and auto-rolls-back if a new build fails to start. No telemetry, no pricing — still 100% read-only of the game.
- 🧭 **Web minimap now matches the game.** The `/map` view renders **isometrically**, aligned with the in-game overlay instead of the old top-down/rotated look — with a one-tap **iso ↔ top-down** toggle.
- 📄 **`CHANGELOG.md` now ships next to the exe** (and lands beside it on auto-update).

## [0.19.0] — 2026-07-01
### Added — 🩸 **Buff Icons** *(opt-in — see what dangerous buff an elite is running)*
- 🩸 **Know why that rare just got scary.** When enabled, POE2GPS reads the **active buffs on elite monsters** (Rare / Unique / Boss) and floats short **tier-colored tags below the mob** — a **fire/cold/lightning aura**, **enrage**, a **shield**, **haste**, a temporal bubble, etc. — with a **countdown** for temporary ones. Now you can *see* the empowering aura before it deletes you.
- 🎚️ **Curated + self-growing.** A built-in catalog maps the combat-relevant buffs to a readable name + **danger tier** 🔴 *Deadly* · 🟠 *Notable* · 🔵 *Minor*; anything uncatalogued is auto-tiered by heuristic and prettified, while pure engine-noise buffs are suppressed. A **"Display ALL" diagnostic** + an **observed-buffs panel** in the dashboard let you (and the community) grow the catalog from real fights — same approach as affix nameplates and Preload Alert.
- 🎛️ Tune it in **⚙️ Settings → Buff Icons**: enable, danger tier, per-rarity (Rare/Unique/Magic), max tags, show-all.
- 🥷 **Stealth-first, off by default.** When off it reads **nothing** — buff reads are gated on the feature and only run for elites you're near, and each buff's id is cached. Fully in line with the Stealth Reads pass.
- 🛡️ **100% read-only.** One new (patch-validated) memory read, **no input, no pricing, no writes**. Tags render through the same camera projection as HP bars / affix nameplates.

## [0.18.0] — 2026-07-01
### Changed — 🥷 **Performance v3: Stealth Reads** *(read the game less, see exactly the same thing)*
- 🩶 **The overlay now reads the game's memory far less often** — a smaller footprint and less CPU, with **zero change to anything you see**. Every dot, HP bar, nameplate, arrow, route, and the atlas behave identically; the only thing that moves is the **`reads/sec` counter** (watch it drop live in the dashboard / `⚙️` status).
- 🎛️ **Reads now scale with the features you actually use.** If a feature is **off**, the overlay stops reading the data that fed it — so a lean setup reads dramatically less. Affix nameplates off → no monster-mod reads. Ground-item overlay off → no dropped-item reads. Atlas content-icons / auto-route / hide-filters off → those per-node reads stop. (All fail-safe: anything a feature needs is always read.)
- 🌌 **Atlas got the biggest cut.** While the Atlas is open it used to re-scan **~20,000 memory reads *every tick*** — even sitting still. Now the static per-node data is **cached**, off-screen nodes are **culled** before reading, and the current-node poll is slowed to ~1/s. Panning, routing, rings, arrows, and content icons look exactly the same.
- 😴 **Idle when you're away.** While **PoE2 isn't the focused window** (alt-tabbed), the overlay stops its per-frame reads entirely (it isn't drawing anyway) and picks right back up on focus. Streamers/dashboard-watchers with "always-show" on are unaffected.
- ⚡ **Smarter live reads.** De-duplicated redundant per-frame reads, cached values that never change (character name), and slowed reads for things that change slower than the eye (level, %-vitals, POI completion, monolith data) — every one imperceptible.
- 🛡️ **100% read-only, no new offsets.** This release only *removes* reads; it adds nothing. Fully compliant, and every feature verified unchanged.

## [0.17.0] — 2026-07-01
### Added — 🛰️ **Remote Views** *(see your overlay from anywhere on your network)*
- 🌐 **Remote Access (LAN)** *(opt-in — off by default)* — flip one toggle and the overlay's pages become reachable from **other devices on your network**: open `http://<your-ip>:7777/obs` on your **stream-capture PC**, or `…/map` on a **phone / tablet / Raspberry Pi**. **Writes stay locked to your machine** — a LAN device can **view**, but **nobody on your network can change your settings** (every settings write is still loopback-only; LAN peers get a `403`). Needs an **app restart** to apply, and Windows will ask to allow POE2GPS through the **firewall** the first time. The dashboard shows your live **LAN URLs** once it's on. *(Reads are unauthenticated over your LAN by design — only enable it on a network you trust.)*
- 🗺️ **Web minimap** — a brand-new standalone page at `http://localhost:7777/map`: a clean **top-down radar** of the **walkable terrain + live dots (monsters by rarity · POI · friendlies) + your position**, centred on you and updating live. **Drop it fullscreen on a second monitor, a phone, or a Raspberry Pi below your main screen** and stop tabbing the in-game map open. Zoom with **+ / −**. Costs **nothing when nobody's viewing it** — it only does work while a browser has it open. Pair it with Remote Access above to run it on that Pi. 🥧
- 🛡️ Both are **100% read-only** of the game — **no new offsets, no new memory reads**, no input, no pricing. They're just new *views* of data the overlay already reads; both default to **off / zero-cost**.

## [0.16.0] — 2026-06-30
### Added — 📡 **Streaming & Presence** *(two ways to share your session)*
- 🎥 **OBS overlay** — a **transparent, stream-styled page** at `http://localhost:7777/obs`. Add it as a **Browser Source** in OBS and your session stats composite right over gameplay: session/zone timers, area + level, **kills** (N·M·R·U), **maps/hr**, **XP-efficiency**, next objective. Pick which widgets show + colour/opacity/scale/corner in **⚙️ Settings → OBS Overlay**. Built on the data the overlay already publishes — no new reads.
- 🎮 **Discord Rich Presence** *(opt-in — off by default)* — show your PoE2 run in your Discord status: **`{area} · Level {level}`**, maps/hr, an **elapsed timer**. **You write the templates** (tokens `{area} {level} {zones} {mapshr} {kills} {xpeff}`), and it runs under a **neutral app identity** — friends see your progress, not "an overlay tool." Publishes **only to your local Discord**, on its own thread so it never touches the game loop.
  - *One-time setup:* paste a Discord **Client ID** in **⚙️ Settings → Discord Rich Presence** to activate it (blank = inert).
- 🛡️ Both are **100% read-only** of the game — no new offsets, no new reads, no input, no pricing. OBS stays on localhost; Discord RP is your explicit opt-in.

## [0.15.0] — 2026-06-30
### Added — 🧭 **Situational Awareness** *(two awareness upgrades)*
- ➡️ **Off-screen entity arrows** *(on by default; seeded for Uniques + Bosses)* — when a notable monster is **off the edge of your screen**, an **arrow at the window border points right at it**, colour-matched to its rule — so you spot the unique/boss/pack **before it comes into view**. It's driven by your existing **display rules**: flip the new **"off-screen arrow"** checkbox on any rule to include it. Nearest-first with a **cap** so dense packs stay readable. Tune size / label / max in **⚙️ Settings → Entity Arrows**.
- 📊 **Session HUD v2** — three new opt-in lines for the run tracker:
  - 💀 **Kills (observed)** — a live tally by rarity (**N · M · R · U**), counted from monsters you watch die. *(Honest by design: it counts the kills it witnesses, so huge off-screen AoE clears read a touch low.)*
  - 🗺️ **Maps/hr** — your map-zone throughput (town/hideout trips don't count).
  - 📈 **XP-efficiency** — `your level − area level` (e.g. `+3` over-levelled · `−5` under-levelled), at a glance.
  - Toggle them in **⚙️ Settings → Session HUD**; reset with **Ctrl+Alt+R** like the rest.
- 🛡️ Both are **100% read-only** — built entirely on data the overlay already reads (**no new offsets**, no new reads). No input, no pricing.

## [0.14.0] — 2026-06-30
### Added — 🔮 **Preload Alert** *(opt-in — off by default · experimental)*
- 🔮 **Know what's in the zone the moment you load in.** When you enter an area, POE2GPS reads the list of assets the game just loaded and calls out the **notable content waiting for you** — **pinnacle bosses** (Arbiters · Xesht · Kosis · Omniphobia · …), **league encounters** (Breach · Ritual · Expedition · Abyss · Incursion · Delirium · …), **Rogue/Conqueror exiles**, and **valuable chests** — as a tidy **corner panel**, tier-coloured 🔴 *pinnacle* · 🟠 *high* · 🟡 *mechanic* · 🔵 *interactable*.
  - 🧠 **Self-tuning noise filter** — the game always keeps a lot of assets resident, so a naive read would flag *everything*. POE2GPS learns which paths show up in **every** zone (base noise) and **suppresses them**, surfacing only what's *genuinely this zone*. Tune the aggressiveness (**common-noise threshold** + **warm-up zones**) yourself.
  - 🎚️ **Your call** — a **minimum tier** to display, an optional **audio cue** when *(≥ a tier you pick)* content loads, corner **anchor + offset**, and a **🔬 Diagnostic view** in the dashboard that shows every matched path with its zone-frequency, so you (and the community) can help grow the catalog.
  - Flip it on in **⚙️ Settings → Preload Alert (experimental)**. **100% read-only** — it only *reads* the asset list the game already loaded and draws text. No prices, no trade, no input. 🛡️
### Changed
- 🧰 **Dev tooling** — new `--preload` Research probe (one-click launcher) that validates the loaded-files reader live per patch.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-06-29
### Added — 🌌 **Atlas QoL** *(a 7-part upgrade to the Atlas overlay)*
- 👁️ **Content icons on fogged maps** *(on by default)* — the game hides a map's content art until you reveal the tile. POE2GPS now stamps the **content glyph** (🌀 Breach · 💀 Boss · 🔮 Essence · ⛏️ Expedition · 🩸 Ritual · 📦 Strongbox · …) **right on the fogged node**, so you can see *what's out there* **before** committing a single point. 15 crisp built-in icons; size + on/off in **Settings**.
- 🎯 **Built-in Map Targets** *(seeded once, additively)* — a fresh install now **highlights the maps that matter out of the box** — every **Citadel**, the **Halls**, and key uniques — ring + route + off-screen arrow, zero setup. Purely additive: your own rules are never touched.
- 🎨 **Colour groups** — define a named, coloured set (e.g. *Citadels* → gold, *Uniques* → orange) and **every member map recolours together**. Add / edit / remove groups live from the **Atlas** dashboard tab.
- 🧹 **Hide filters** — **Hide completed** *(on)* sweeps run maps off the overlay, and **Hide accessible-only** *(off)* declutters the adjacent frontier — so the Atlas shows what's *left to do*, not what's done.
- 🗂️ **Data-driven map intel** — a bundled GGG-data layer resolves each node's **display name · type · content tags** (`unique` · `lineage` · `arbiter` · …), powering a new **Type** filter axis and richer tooltips.
- ➡️ **Directional route chevrons** — auto-routes and your **F10** path now draw **arrowheads** showing travel direction; overlapping routes **interleave** so each stays readable.
- 🩹 **Off-screen route fix** *(correctness)* — route segments no longer **jitter / wobble** when a node sits off-screen (off-screen positions are noisy, so those segments are now cleanly culled).
- 🛡️ **Still 100% read-only.** Everything above only **reads** atlas memory the game already exposes + bundled static data, and **draws**. No pricing, no trade, no input — same compliance bar as always.

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-29
### Added
- ✨ **Affix nameplates** *(opt-in — off by default)* — see an elite monster's dangerous **modifiers floating right above its head**, on screen, **no mouse hover needed**. Each rare/unique shows *its own* affixes, color-coded by danger.
  - 🎯 **Danger tiers** — a curated masterlist turns raw ids into readable names (`MonsterPhysicalDamageAura1` → "Physical Damage Aura") and ranks them **Deadly · Notable · Minor**; anything uncurated is auto-prettified, so nothing is ever missed.
  - 🎛️ **Customizable filters** — pick a **tier threshold** (Deadly only · Deadly + Notable · All), add per-affix **Always-show / Hide** overrides, or flip **Display all** to show every affix. Choose which rarities count (Rare / Unique / Magic).
  - Turn it on in **Settings → Affix nameplates** (ships collapsed). 100% read-only — it only reads mods PoE2 already exposes and draws text; never sends input.
### Fixed
- 🔧 **RuneStation offsets** re-validated for the 2026-06-25 patch (folded from upstream) — runeshape-monolith reads were stale (`ListenerSub 0x98→0xA0`, `RuneStride 0x6c→0x68`).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-28
### Changed
- **Performance v2 — fewer memory reads per tick** (still strictly read-only; *no change to what the overlay reads or draws*): a second optimization pass aimed at ReadProcessMemory syscalls/sec on the world hot path.
  - **One bucket read per new monster instead of ~6** — each entity's components (render / position / life / rarity / minimap-icon / chest) now resolve in a single pass. The biggest per-pack reduction.
  - **Cached, slowly-refreshed hostility** — friend/foe is read once per monster and re-checked about once a second (so enemy↔friendly conversions still flip), instead of every tick — a large saving on dense maps.
  - **Cached opened chests**, **one bulk read for the minimap element** (was 5 reads/frame), **bulk mod reads**, and the world thread's **player vital-offset latch** no longer re-reads three vitals every tick.
  - **Fewer allocations** — the per-tick entity list is reused (triple-buffered), the terrain unpack buffer is pooled via `ArrayPool`, and mod de-duplication is now O(n).
### Added
- **`rpmPerSec` in `/state`** — a live reads/sec readout (next to `worldMs` / `renderMs`) so you can watch the footprint yourself.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Custom keybinds** — remap the keyboard hotkeys (F6/F7/F9/F10/F12 and the Ctrl+Alt cycle/menu/reset binds) from a new **Keybinds** card in Settings. Still 100% read-only — the overlay only *reads* the keys you choose, never sends input. (Controller R3/L3 and the slot-jump digits stay fixed.)
- **Map-mechanic intelligence** — the Zone summary panel now also counts nearby **league mechanics** (Strongbox, Shrine, Breach, Expedition, Ritual, Essence), and there's a new optional **"mechanic nearby" audio cue**.
- **First-run quick-start** — a welcome card with the essentials, a hotkey cheat-sheet, and a one-click **"Apply recommended setup"**; dismissible, re-openable any time.
- **Settings search & collapsible cards** — a search box filters the Settings cards, and each card collapses (state remembered) so the growing options list stays navigable.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-28
### Added
- **Audio: volume slider + per-event tone picker** — set the alert volume and choose a distinct tone (Chime / Bell / Ding / …) for each event, with a Test button to audition.
- **Preset library** — the Presets card is now a real library: **built-in starter presets** (High-contrast, Minimal, Boss & unique hunter) you can apply in one click, plus **save / name / apply / delete your own** local presets (on top of the existing share-code + file import/export).
- **Zone summary panel** *(opt-in, off by default)* — a compact overlay panel with live counts for the current zone (rares · uniques · chests · exits), anchorable to any corner; its toggle sits prominently at the top of Settings.
### Changed
- The in-app console hotkey banner now lists **Ctrl+Alt+R** (reset Session HUD counters), matching the README.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Audio alerts** *(off by default)* — short, distinct procedurally-generated tones for three high-signal events, each toggleable from a card at the top of Settings: a **rare/unique monster** comes into range, a **unique item** drops, or you **reach your active objective**. A "Test" button auditions each tone. Output only — no input is ever sent to the game.
- **Community presets** — share your radar's *look* (display rules + icon / HP-bar / terrain styles) as a copy-paste **share-code** or a `.poe2preset` file, and import one to adopt someone else's setup instantly. Imports are sanitized + size-bounded, only touch visual config (never operational/anti-detection settings), and auto-save a backup of your current look first.
### Changed
- GitHub Release notes now populate automatically from this changelog.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-27
### Changed
- **Performance & footprint pass** — a head-to-toe optimization sweep, with **no change to what the overlay reads** (still strictly read-only):
  - **~15–20 MB lower idle RAM** — the mod-translation tables now load only when the (default-off) gear scorer actually needs them, instead of eagerly at startup.
  - **Fewer per-frame allocations at high refresh rates** — atlas projection/route geometry, session-HUD text, entity/landmark colors, and the monolith panel are now cached/reused per frame instead of rebuilt every frame.
  - **Lighter world tick** — objective ranking is computed once per tick, the Objective Director reconciles at ~4 Hz (forced on zone change), nav-target building is single-pass, and area hash/level are cached per zone.
  - **Capped session logs** — the seen-POI, entity-atlas, and mod catalogs no longer grow unbounded over a long session.
### Fixed
- A latent data race where the render thread read player vitals through the world thread's memory reader — vitals now use the render thread's own reader. Vital-offset detection also re-validates if it ever latches onto a bad read (e.g. a torn loading-screen frame).

## [0.7.1] — 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Force re-scan** button (Status card) + `POST /api/rescan` — re-detect the game after a patch without restarting.
- **Health pill** in the dashboard masthead — game read-state (in game / connecting / out-of-date) on every tab.
- Controller bindings (R3/L3) in the console hotkey list; the version is now prominent.
### Changed
- WorldLoop clears the radar + rate-limits the log if a tick throws (no stale data / log flood).
- Removed dead/INVALID unreferenced offset stubs from the offset table (internal hygiene).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-27
### Added
- **Campaign GPS** (experimental, off by default) — cross-zone campaign navigation: routes you toward the next critical-path zone's exit, shown on the dashboard Zone Plan + overlay.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-26
### Added
- **Patch-resilience & health/status** — the overlay self-detects when a PoE2 patch breaks the offsets, starts non-fatally and self-connects (works when launched at login), re-attaches after a game restart, and shows a clear update-aware banner + dashboard Status panel instead of failing silently.

## [0.5.2] — 2026-06-26
### Changed
- Target cycling follows the radar-menu order by default; "Intelligent target cycling" (priority/distance) is an opt-in toggle. Hold-to-fast-cycle on controller + keyboard.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-25
